_Cosmonaut_ was released on 16th November, the day before my birthday, a time of reflection and change for the future, when I reflect on just how many albums I’ve reviewed that weren’t bad, just generic… which in a way is even worse than being bad. No one ever remembers ‘it was okay’.

But _Kosm_’s _Cosmonaut_ isn’t bland: it’s the pleasing sound of a band following their own inner vision.

Remember when Mastodon were special, circa _Leviathan_, _Blood Mountain_ and _Crack The Skye_, before that vision was lost?(Interestingly, all those albums featured the work of the now inexplicably absent Paul Romano, something that Mastodon don’t seem to realise has hurt the presentation of their music.) Well, Kosm are like Mastodon in those days.

In Kosm’s own words:

“_Cosmonaut_ is a concept album loosely based on the fiction of HP Lovecraft, and borrowing concepts from the science-fiction of Frank Herbert and Roger Zelazny. The album follows a cosmonaut on a cosmic journey through time and space; from the earthly confines of a mortal life, to ascendancy as an immaterial and omnipotent being. The cosmonaut’s journey is essentially symbolic, serving as a commentary on the human experience: a journey from confusion and anger, to transcendence and self-understanding.”

Kosm is a special band that deserves your support.
