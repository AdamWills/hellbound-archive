One of the most important elements of music is sincerity, and **Iomair** have that in spades. Think of a folky Opeth and you aren’t even half-way there. What I like most about this album is its heartfelt emotionality. This is really music for the inner you, not for the face you put on for the world. Strange and beautiful in equal measure.
