## Dying Fetus, Incantation, Gatecreeper & Genocide Pact at The Opera House in Toronto, 28 October 2018

Once again **Dying Fetus** was back in Toronto. Having already have seen them I went mostly for the supporting acts and boy was this show completely perfect. **Genocide Pact**, **Gatecreeper** and **Incantation** were all absolutely amazing, especially Incantation, death metal legends. Dying Fetus were killer as usual and the pit was lively. This was overall a great death metal show with the perfect lineup. A show like this doesn't come around very often.
