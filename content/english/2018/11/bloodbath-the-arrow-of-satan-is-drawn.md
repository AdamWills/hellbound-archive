To me, _The Arrow Of Satan Is Drawn_ really proves that death metal as a genre has staying power. This album builds on the classic work of Death, Autopsy, Carcass, Entombed and Unleashed and their ilk and forges its sound into something true to its roots, yet very much of the 21st century. The track "Bloodicide" very much proves my point, featuring as it does Jeff Walker from Carcass, Karl Willetts from Bolt Thrower and John Walker from Cancer.

The song-writing and musicianship is superb as you would expect. Moreover, Nick Holmes gives the music a ‘_Lost Paradise/Gothic_’ vibe which pleases me greatly.

This is how it should be done!
