## Death Chopping North American Tour: SUFFOCATION, CATTLE DECAPITATION, KRISIUN, SOREPTION

The "Farewell Frank" tour went absolutely great in Toronto on October 24. Every single act perfectly built hype surrounding Toronto's last time to watch original **Suffocation** vocalist Frank Mullen, live and it was an absolutely killer show. I thoroughly enjoyed every single act especially **Cattle Decapitation** and Suffocation. It was an absolutely bittersweet goodbye.
