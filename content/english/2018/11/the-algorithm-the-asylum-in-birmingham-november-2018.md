## The Algorithm, November 14th, 2018 at The Asylum, Birmingham, UK

_Compiler Optimization Techniques_ is the fourth effort from French duo **The Algorithm** – a project of Rémi Gallego with his drummer Jean Ferry has grown now into a formidable live act. Guitars, bass, synths, drums combined; electronic, dance, progressive metal, mathcore – whatever basket we put them into it is one of a kind experience.

The album's release on November 2nd was followed by a brief 11-date tour across UK and Europe with **Neoslave**, a relatively new project in the synthwave scene or as the man calls himself, "A new master of dark Synth".
