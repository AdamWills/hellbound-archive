In 2008, **Anathema** were one of the first bands to sign to progressive label KScope. Which makes sense as their music has constantly progressed, with founders Vincent and Danny Cavanagh being the constant factors.

In 2018, Anathema are very different to the band that signed to the mighty Peaceville Records almost two decades previously. Then, they were part of a trio of doom/death bands with Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride (both still going strongly today).

Anathema’s music progressed from day one and this compilation is the logical result of this. Today, they have more in common with Pink Floyd and King Crimson that Death or Autopsy, but their music remains sincere and heartfelt, which is what all true artists should aim for.
