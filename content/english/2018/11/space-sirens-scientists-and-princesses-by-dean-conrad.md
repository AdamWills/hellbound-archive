Nowadays, women are rightly a central part of science fiction films, but it was not always so. In early science fiction films women were usually assistants, eye candy, or there to give the square-jawed male hero someone to save from the flying killer bots from the planet Zog!

Speaking of the splendid _Mad Max: Fury Road_, one of my all time favourite films... Coming out of the cinema from seeing it for the first time (though not the last by any stretch of the imagination), I commented that _Mad Max: Fury Road_ was the first feminist post-apocalypse action movie blockbuster (I said as much in my [Hellbound film review](https://www.hellbound.ca/2015/06/mad-max-fury-road-a-hellbound-movie-review/)). I also commented that George Miller had clearly read Joseph Campbell’s _The Hero With A Thousand Faces_, something he subsequently confirmed in an interview.

Conrad covers more than 650 films, and truly has produced a titanic and important work.
