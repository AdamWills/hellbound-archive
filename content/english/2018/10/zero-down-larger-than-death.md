Minotauro Records are synonymous with quality. I have yet to listen to a release from that esteemed label and not be impressed. But even by their high standards **Zero Down** are truly excellent. Their songs are really catchy and strong, think classic Priest or Maiden. The production is first class and all the band members are outstanding in their own musical fields. This is metal made by lifers who love. And all wrapped up fabulous [Ed Repka artwork](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Artist/Ed-Repka-Illustration-135060286561078/).

Essential for anyone who truly loves metal.
