## September 16th 2018 O2 – Academy Birmingham

The show opener this evening was **This Burning Age** with their alternative rock somewhat haunting, violently beautiful, atmospheric, dark and broody. A band to watch out for!

Wasn't the best of nights for Coventry based Goth outfit **Deadfilmstar**. The warpaint make-up disappeared in the smoky darkness as much as their front man Gary's black contacts and there was a feel of struggle to keep the set together.

Hailed in rock magazines as genre's new hope, voted by Metal Hammer 'Best British Heavy Metal Band', consisting of members previously working with Gary Newman, Marilyn Manson, The Prodigy, The Jesus And Mary Chain and many others, industrial veterans **Sulpher** delivered a strong set. With barely any light, the stage buried in smoke was sinking in the sounds of distinctively gritty industrial rock with dark and dirty feel to it – yet incredibly atmospheric.

### Jayce Lewis in concert

Out on his first headline tour of UK, Welsh act **Jayce Lewis** has got clear Gary Newman influences in his industrial fused electro rock pieces – not that his music would need any labels. The small, but enthusiastic crowd of fans were definitely enjoying themselves.

There were quite a few tracks in tonight's set from Jayce's 2014 album _Nemesis_, as well as from his latest record _Million_, which came out at the end of 2017.

_Million_ is a concept album in two parts. As said by Lewis himself:

‘Right from the beginning, I wanted this to be a concept album…… to take the listener on a committed journey, a series. The subject matter mostly touches on personal experiences, discovery, loss and general life. I think many things within society today has influenced its direction, especially the rapid evolution of technology.’

_Million_ Part2 was released on October 12th 2018.
