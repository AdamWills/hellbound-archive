Last month Hellbound's Gene Gaona spent some time in Texas with Philip H. Anselmo and The Illegals along with the opening bands on the Choosing Mental Illness as a Virtue tour. We shared Gene's interview with Anselmo and Mike De Leon already. Now we have another peak into those few days courtesy of an interview with King Parrot's Matt Young.
