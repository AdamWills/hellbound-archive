**Windhand** has consistently been one of my favourite doom bands of the past few years. They’ve shown that “female-fronted doom” isn’t limited to cloaks, capes and songs about Satan while cranking out a string of pretty solid records. But when I heard the initial press describing _Eternal Return_ as a “doom/grunge” album, namedropping the likes of Soundgarden and Veruca Salt, I had reason for concern. And leadoff single “Grey Garden” didn’t really grab me—the riffs were buried in the mix. So this all left me wondering if we had another [Royal Thunder situation](https://hellbound.ca/2015/04/royal-thunder-crooked-doors-2/) on our hands…

At least this record is still pretty heavy. “Halcyon” kicks things off with 8+ minutes of the kind of fuzz-laden, head-nodding riffs that Windhand fans have grown accustomed to, while still maintaining some pleasant melodies. Yes, the vocals are a little higher on this one, although that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. And I definitely dig the slow-mo instro breakdown that kicks in somewhere shy of six minutes. But I’ll be damned if I don’t hear some of those grunge influences that they were referring to in the media kit…

“Grey Garden” comes next, a song I was decidedly nonplussed about upon first listen. The main riff has enough of a fuzzy kick to it, but it’s a bit bland and repetitive, not heavy enough to get this here head nodding. And the melodic chorus gives me a case of Royal Thunder reflux. After a languid, three-minute Americana interlude (“Pilgrim’s Rest”) – which I actually quite like – they bring back another extended offering with “First to Die,” a fuzz-laden number that wouldn’t sound too outta place on their previous efforts, although I think it has a slightly softer sheen. The soaring chorus works really well on this one, but halfway through the tracklisting, I’m still lukewarm.

After a spacey instrumental interlude (“Light Into Dark”), we get something that might not have sounded out of place on the radio in 1997. “Red Cloud” clocks in at a compact 4:15, and there are definite shades of Soundgarden and maybe even Alice in Chains here. Not a bad thing… but not what I was expecting. Come to think of it, that would probably sum up the album as a whole. While every other Windhand record I’ve heard was an 8+ in my books, this one’s no better than a 7.

The good news is that there’s a return to vintage Windhand toward the end in the form of 11-minute epic “Eyeshine.” Put this one on your Spotify playlist…and maybe add 13-and-a-half-minute album closer “Feather” while you’re at it.
