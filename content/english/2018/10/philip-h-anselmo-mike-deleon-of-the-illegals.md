What can I say, life is a trip sometimes... literally. In early September I caught a flight out of San José, California to the great state of Texas to catch up with Philip H. Anselmo and The Illegals and label mates King Parrot.

I met up with both bands in San Antonio on the second stop of their tour; The Illegals were on the road to support their latest record _Choosing Mental Illness as a Virtue_. I was lucky enough to catch all three Texas shows which took me through the wonderful cities of San Antonio, Dallas, and Houston.

Not only did I get a peek behind the curtain, I was literally behind the curtain, and got a firm understanding of what goes on in the day to day life and grind of a professional band. I mean, as a fan you have an idea, and until you see all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes first hand, you really will never know. The blood sweat and tears, the heat and humidity of late summer in Texas, the incredibly long hours and miles spent on the road — it’s all pretty brutal and gave me a complete new appreciation for what my friends, and favorite bands, go through.

On the last day I was with the bands in Houston I was fortunate enough to grab a few interviews with various members of The Illegals and King Parrot (Thank you Miss Kate!). I hope you enjoy them.

New West Coast tour dates coming soon for the second leg of the _Choosing Mental Illness as a Virtue_ tour and this time Child Bite will be direct support for The Illegals. If you like heavy extreme music, I suggest you buy a ticket to a show; you will not be disappointed.
