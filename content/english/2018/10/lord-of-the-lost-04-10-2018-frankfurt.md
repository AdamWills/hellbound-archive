The "Thornstar" tour kicks off masterfully on the 4th of October in Batschkapp Frankfurt. The Hamburge dark metal band Lord of the Lost is out conquering the European stages with their 7th album release. _Thornstar_ is a concept album – lovingly researched and reproduced down to the last detail – about the demise of the Pangaen culture.

The show was opened by **Scarlet Dorn**, also a dark rock band that had their debut album _Lack of Light_ released this year.

**Lord of the Lost** hits the stage to offer an impressive live performance. It was a grand happening of sweat, intense and unforgettable experience. Along their 23 songs setlist, the band gave the night an unique atmosphere by putting together an amazing live performance, with vocal prowess and an ever-impressive range of styles that can abruptly leap from a sonorous clear singing voice to brutal death growls or wild screaming.

This, together with an outstanding lights show, drums solo and simply good vibes, the band kept the public engaged the whole night.
