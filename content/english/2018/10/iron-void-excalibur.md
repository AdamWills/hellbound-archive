The tale of Arthur and his sword Excalibur is one of the great stories of heroism and in the world we live in now, we need such stories more than ever. Yet ‘_Excalibur_’ is a very human story, the characters have all the normal human virtues and vices, which is why the tale still resonates today, it speaks to a deeper truth within. Heroism is an important concept. The brave die but once, cowards die thousands of times over.

Personally speaking, I love John Boorman’s ‘_Excalibur_’, a beautiful epic piece of art, partially filmed not far from where I write this.

Iron Void are a truly great heavy metal ban, driven by their love of the music, and ‘_Excalibur_’ is their greatest work yet. Their musicianship and creativity is first class, this is timeless, trend-free music that would appeal to anyone who loves music as well as metal.

It’s a very accomplished inspiring album, and in the current dismal climate for creativity, you can imagine the time and sacrifice that went into creating it.

Anyone who loves the NWOBHN, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, The Obsessed and St Vitus, will find much to love here.
