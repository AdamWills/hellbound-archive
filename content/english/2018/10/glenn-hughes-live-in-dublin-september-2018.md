## Glenn Hughes Plays Classic Deep Purple live at the Olympia, Dublin

### Sunday, September 30th, 2018

I always loved the **Deep Purple** albums featuring the talents of **Glenn Hughes** and David Coverdale, on the _Burn,_ _Stormbringer_ and _Come Taste The Band_ albums respectively. In recent years Coverdale revisited his Deep Purple heritage with ‘_The Purple Album_’ and tour, and now Glenn is following in his footsteps. With far superior results. Glenn still has that amazing voice, simple as that.

In the setting of Dublin’s beautiful Victorian Olympia theatre, Glenn and his band (a really, really good band) do full justice to a fantastic set of Purple material, including songs like ‘Highway Star’ that he didn’t originally play on the studio versions (again, he does his material full justice here to).

Moreover, I have to say this is one of the best gigs I have ever attended, both band and audience in happy harmony. Highlights are hard to choose, but ‘Burn’, ‘Highway Star’ and especially my all time favourite Deep Purple track ‘You Keep On Moving’ off _Come Taste The Band_ (a real proto-metal song this one!)

Glenn just radiates love for his audience and music, and you know what?: in this cynical age that’s as precious as the wonderful music he plays, something an equally wonderful and un-cynical audience appreciated!
