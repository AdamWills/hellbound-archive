Some people might say Matt Pike’s the new Lemmy, but when it comes to **High On Fire**’s consistency, I’d compare them to AC/DC. As they enter their 20th year as a band, you pretty much know what you’re gonna get before you push play – and yet, I can’t say I was disappointed by _Electric Messiah_.

Some songs are shorter and faster than others, with opening track “Spewn from the Earth” clocking in as the shortest at just under four minutes. Suffice to say this is a signature slice of HOF’s mid-tempo thrash/sludge hybrid—we’ve heard a few tunes like this before, but it still packs a wallop. From there they slow things down and stretch ‘em out with the nine-and-a-half-minute epic “Steps of the Ziggurat/House of Enlil.” The gloomy, head-nodding riff that opens this one is surprisingly mellow, with a plodding, pounding Des Kensel drumbeat driving the first couple minutes, before they move into a menacing, mid-tempo march slightly reminiscent of Neurosis. This song isn’t going anywhere fast until the seven-minute mark, when a vicious, angular riff slices through the proceedings, signalling a slight shift in tempo towards Conan territory, but still anchored by Pike’s trademark sneer.

The Lemmy-inspired title track ups the tempo right from the get-go, with a pummelling riff/double-kick combo that almost borders on death metal. But from there, we get the longest, slowest song on here, with 10 and a half minutes of “Sanctioned Annihilation.” Pike’s screams are more tortured than ever as the band grinds forward like the gears of a machine, although this one does drag on a little too long.

The next few tracks range from mid-paced, murky death/doom (“The Pallid Mask”) to pounding, plodding semi-Slayer worship (“God of the Godless”) to another full-speed-ahead killdozer (“Freebooter”). While some of the usual suspects still remain, I’m glad to hear at least a couple surprises along the way.
