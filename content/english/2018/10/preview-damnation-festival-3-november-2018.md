## Damnation Festival 2018, November 3rd, Leeds, UK

While the first weekend in November will be hosting Guy Fawkes celebrations across the country, Leeds University will have its own reason to celebrate: **Damnation Festival 2018,** which will be taking place on **November 3rd** at **Leeds University's Student Union.**

Over the years the festival has featured a vast number of bands of various metal genres, and this year its 14th edition will be hosting near 30 bands on four stages, with, as usual, a brilliant line up.

Celebrating their 30th anniversary with a special one-off show, **Cancer** will play the Jägermeister Stage alongside the likes of British extreme metal legends **Napalm** **Death**, Swedish death metal act **Entombed AD** and Birmingham, UK extreme metallers **Anaal Nathrakh**. Damnation Festival 2018 will be hosting quite a few exclusive UK performances: the frontman of Emperor- **Ihsahn**, Polish black metal legion **Batushka**, Australian progressive metal six- piece **Ne Obliviscaris**, amongst others.

Leeds' own progressive black metal band, [**A Forest Of Stars**](https://www.facebook.com/aforestofstars/?fref=mentions&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDzW_HVoNXW1DVUMyxnN-zG3LrdnL6-PYR2s4IcMLfFG6EXXpl_IKx00qq1YkpvSD5MEiuv2Cij-O7ovwsAst3Hw0lct2fp4spoGounRxZP1YqYRrLAFc1uCtOyiYHYMZSD3WuT0vQGyfQH-zcQb13GZBvmDpsYp-mYD-9yhv3aWAmSRaAkXA&__tn__=K-R), fresh from a great performance at Bloodstock, will treat us with an hour-long set on the [Cult Never Dies](https://www.facebook.com/CultNeverDies/?fref=mentions&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDzW_HVoNXW1DVUMyxnN-zG3LrdnL6-PYR2s4IcMLfFG6EXXpl_IKx00qq1YkpvSD5MEiuv2Cij-O7ovwsAst3Hw0lct2fp4spoGounRxZP1YqYRrLAFc1uCtOyiYHYMZSD3WuT0vQGyfQH-zcQb13GZBvmDpsYp-mYD-9yhv3aWAmSRaAkXA&__tn__=K-R) Stage.
