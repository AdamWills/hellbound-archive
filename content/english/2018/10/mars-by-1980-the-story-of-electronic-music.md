## by David Stubbs

Electronic music is everywhere now. Look at the TV series ‘_Stranger Things_’, for example, with its John Carpenter-inspired synth-scapes. ‘_Mars By 1980_’ tells the story of how music got to this point. It was a long time getting here but now the future has arrived.

### The book is split into four main parts:

**Part 1** describes the birth of electronic music and is indeed an education to read; very little of this was I aware of so a great pleasure to learn of it in such detail.

**Part 2** covers the work of such individuals as Stevie Wonder, Sun Ra and Miles Davis.

My favourite part of the book is **part 3** covering bands I love such as Kraftwerk, New Order, Depeche Mode and The Human League. As well as being electronic bands we would do well to remember these were all pop bands too – and bloody good as well!

**Part 4** takes us up to now with artists such as Brian Eno, who could well have a book unto himself.

I must question the absence of John Carpenter in this book – as well as producing many wonderful synth-driven soundtracks, he has been a great influence on many modern artists, Zombi and Survive, for example.

But this aside, the splendidly named ‘_Mars By 1980_’ is an informative read indeed.
