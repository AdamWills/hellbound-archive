This month we continue a revived Hellbound tradition – our monthly staff picks/playlists. Every few weeks we ask our regular and longtime contributors to weigh in on what they’re listening to, watching, going to see… Expect a few quirks and idiosyncrasies now and then, but these are our standard staff pick categories:

**Listening to** – an album, ep or song from the library shelves (something that isn’t new) **New release** – a worthy album, ep or song released within the past couple of months **Live** – a recently enjoyed or highly anticipated live recording or gig **Non-metal** – an album, ep or song of choice from the non-metal world **Wild card** – a recommendation outside of or beyond the above picks

One extra pick for this month: we also asked Hellbounders to name their **favourite heavy release of 2018... so far**.

### Bianca Bobescu

**Listening to:** Tribulation - "Spell" (_The Formulas of Death_, 2013)

**New release:** Tribulation – _Down Below_ (released 26/01/2018). Not new but I discovered it recently and I totally recommend it.

**Live:** Durbuy Rock Festival, Belgium 6-7 April \[review: [day 1](https://www.hellbound.ca/2018/04/durbuy-rock-festival-april-2018-day-1/) / [day 2](https://www.hellbound.ca/2018/04/durbuy-rock-festival-april-2018-day-2/)\]

### Steve Earles

**Listening to:** one album not new, Metallica's _Death Magnetic_. I resisted this when it came out as even my patience was exhausted by years of disappointment. But _Death Magnetic_ really has a raw 80s thrash/NWOBHM metal vibe. I love the production (no apologies for that, it's an antidote to pro-tools; to me the first four Venom albums have the best production ever, as do the first four Bathory albums). And "All Nightmare Long" is a classic.

**New release:** Judas Priest _Firepower_. Just a special band; when they are gone, there will be a void that can't be filled, so make the most of the Priest while they are still here.

**Live:** Amsovel at Siege of Limerick this Easter. A great festival always, and Amsovel had a killer raw Venom/ Motorhead/ Hawkwind vibe. The real deal, a special band even though they don't know it (which may be one of the things that makes this trio special).

**Wild card:** Mick Fleetwood's _Play On_ autobiography. A musical soap opera – the Mac must be one of the most screwed up bands of all time – a masterclass in what not to do, and well worth a read (as I type this, their line-up has changed once again; at this rate I'll be joining soon).

**Best metal of 2018 so far:** C.O.C's _No Cross, No Crown_. An admirable sentiment, and a superb album. We need more bands of this quality and sincerity.

### Gene A. Gaona

**Listening to:** John Carpenter’s _Anthology_

**New release:** Vitamin X – _Age Of Paranoia_ (released date May 5th via Southern Lord). A good old fashioned early 80’s Punk sounding record.

**Live:** Dying Fetus and Thy Art is Murder live in San Jose were both amazing.

**Non-metal:** _Saturday Night Fever_ Soundtrack

**Wild card:** My recent visit to the famed Rainbow Bar and Grill in Hollywood CA was unbelievably cool; I even did a little write up on the experience.

### Gruesome Greg

**Listening to:** Brujeria - _La raza odiada_ (Roadrunner)

**New release:** [Body Void - _I Live Inside a Burning House_](https://hellbound.ca/2018/04/body-void-i-live-inside-a-burning-house/)

**Live:** Acid Mothers Temple @ The Garrison, April 17

**Non-metal:** [Lindi Ortega - The Comeback Kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me6aoX0wCV8&feature=youtu.be)

**Wild card:** Recently discovered the David Simon show _Treme_, set in post-Katrina New Orleans, with some of the leading actors from _The Wire_. Great stuff!

**Best metal of 2018 so far:** Corrosion of Conformity – _No Cross, No Crown_ is going to be right up there, for sure.

### Danielle Griscti

**Listening to:** [Belus - _Apophenia_](https://belus.bandcamp.com/). Doomy, psychedelic black metal from Brooklyn.

**New release:** [Aura Noir - _Aura Noire_](https://auranoir.bandcamp.com/). Endlessly repeatable "trash" metal. Out April 27th from Indie recordings.

**Live:** [Reptoid](https://reptoiddeathmetal.bandcamp.com/releases) - live at Coalition, Toronto, April 19th. Straight up face-ripping death metal.

**Non-metal:** Carpenter Brut - [_Leather Teeth_](https://carpenterbrut.bandcamp.com/album/leather-teeth). Absolutely danceable synthwave.

**Wild card:** [_The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force_](https://www.amazon.ca/Mind-Brain-Neuroplasticity-Power-Mental/dp/0060988479) - Jeffrey M. Schwartz & Sharon Begley. Fascinating foray into the far reaches of our mysterious minds.

### Matt Hinch

**Listening to:** I've been [bingeing on old stuff](https://open.spotify.com/album/6whTeeqC0oPS7EAtBuulQK) recently. Monster Magnet, Brant Bjork, The Sword, and most recently Hermano.

**New release:** I'm gonna go with [_Used Future_ by the Sword](http://thesword.bandcamp.com/album/used-future). It sparked my back catalog binge. It is quite different than their first 3 or 4 albums, but also different than _High Country_. People have been ripping on this but there's only one real dud if you cut out the interludes.

**Non-metal:** I'm walking a fine line here but I've been using [_Lullaby Renditions of Iron Maiden_](https://open.spotify.com/album/1XSMeekCezPaPv9NR68TXL) to put my daughter to bed.

**Wild-card:** I recently watched the extended versions of the three _Lord of the Rings_ movies. It had been SO long. The _Hobbit_ movies are next.

**Best of 2018 so far:** Some tough competition from the likes of COC, Monster Magnet and Fu Manchu but the surprise release of [_The Sciences_ by Sleep](https://open.spotify.com/album/790MeSzafcgXNCoY2AagnP) on 4/20 takes the cake. It keeps getting better every listen and "Giza Butler" has found a special place in my heart. Al Cisneros is a monster. Matt Pike is Matt Pike. Jason Roeder makes me not cry that Chris Hakius quit music. Couldn't ask for anything more.  \[Sleep – The Sciences [reviewed](https://www.hellbound.ca/2018/04/sleep-the-sciences/) by Gruesome Greg\]

### Gabe Hugh

**Listening to:**

Robin Trowler - _Time and emotion_. My favorite album of 2017 filled with awesome blues rock riffs and creative song writing.

Anciients - _Heart of Oak_. The band really deserved the Juno win. I like this album I find it had equal parts Opeth, High on Fire and Death in just the right amount. Progressive metal at its best.

Striker - _Stand in the Fire_. Ripping speed metal mixed with power and some trash epics. Good for a Saturday night beer drinking and headbanging gathering.

Paradise Lost - _The Plague Within_. PL wrote a fantastic album last year called _Medusa_ but this little precursor has all the tidbits you want with a classic PL album. You have your death, doom, groove and gothic melodies, riffs and choruses that epics are made of.

Peter Green - _The end of the game_. Just a straight up guitar driven psych album. Listeners will find it so easy to get lost in the hypnotic riffs that seem to go on forever. Might say this is a masterpiece for whose so love psych and guitar playing. More than a few modern players have used this one as a benchmark in the style.

**New release:** Slugdge - _Esoteric Malacology_ (Willowtip Records)

**Live:** April 11 - Russian Circles w/ King Woman @ Horseshoe Tavern, Toronto. What spectacular musicians!

**Non-metal:** The Weakerthans - _Reconstruction Site_ (Epitaph)

**Wild card:** I've been vending at some seriously rad artisan markets this past month including my favourite one - Bazaar Of The Bizarre! Occurring roughly twice a year at The Spice Factory in Hamilton (as well as Toronto), this gathering of macabre and misfit crafters is a one stop shop for local, handcrafted goods on the "edgier" side. It's always a nice afternoon out, and I love that I can grab a beer and drink while I shop.

**Best metal of 2018 so far:** I've got high hopes for that Graveyard new album _Peace_! (Nuclear Blast)

* * *

### Laura Wiebe

**Listening to:** Loss – _Horizonless_ and Bathsheba – _Servus_

**New release:** Audrey Horne – _Blackout_ (Napalm, released 12 January 2018)

**Non-metal:** Phil Collins-era Genesis and early Phil Collins, inspired by the audiobook version of Phil's autobiography, _Not Dead Yet_

**Wild card:** After years of procrastinating, I was finally persuaded by [Greber](https://greber.bandcamp.com/)'s Steve and Marc to start watching _The Wire_. When I'm not watching NBA playoff games.

**Best metal of 2018 so far:** Harakiri For The Sky – _Arson_ (AOP)
