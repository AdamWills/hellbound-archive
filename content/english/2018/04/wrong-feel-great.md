When a noise-rock record is called _Feel Great_, you know it’s probably being used ironically. The sophomore effort from this Florida outfit offers little in the way of positive vibes or uplifting feelings throughout its 11-track, 30-minute runtime.

“Errordome” kicks off this effort with some chunky, gurgling slowcore à la Unsane, throwing in a few stop-start riffs for good measure. “Culminate” slows things down slightly, offering up a ground-and-pound attack, more akin to Prong. The mid-tempo stomp of “Pustule” ends in a swirl of distorted feedback, while “Nice Job” offers more of a grungy feel a la AIC.

As expected, the title track falls on the gloomier side, a slower number somewhere between the Melvins and Unsane. Although the chorus is somewhat uplifting, I suppose. And “Come Apart Mind” almost sounds like pop punk or old-school emo(!?) Definitely did not see that one coming! Conversely, “Zero Cool” ends with the sound of someone being flogged. Ouch.
