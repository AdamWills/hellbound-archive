The **Melvins** are to bassists what Spinal Tap is to drummers. After recording with no fewer than six bassists on their last album, fittingly titled [_Basses Loaded_](https://hellbound.ca/2016/06/melvins-basses-loaded/), they’ve now employed two permanent four-stringers on this release—Steven McDonald of Redd Kross, who was part of their last tour, and Jeff Pinkus of Butthole Surfers fame, who has also played with them in the past. (Word has it that both bassists will be part of the touring lineup this time around.) What’s more, there are two Butthole Surfers covers on here, including a mashup between the Buttholes and the James Gang(!), along with the most bizarre cover song in Melvins history—the Beatles’ “I Want to Hold Your Hand.”

The album opens with “Stop Moving to Florida,” combining the James Gang’s “Stop” and Butthole Surfers tune “Moving to Florida.” While you’re not likely to hear these two tunes back-to-back on any jukebox in America, Buzzo, Crover and company make the unlikely mashup work... sort of. The 70’s classic rock of the former fades out completely before the latter’s noise-rock stomp kicks in. This might as well be two separate tracks, but hey.

“Embrace the Rub” picks up the pace, a 1:40 poppy punk rock tune that sounds like a cross between Redd Kross and the Dead Kennedys. “Don’t Forget to Breathe” slows things back down, a nearly eight-minute-long number that adds some bluesy accents and swirling synths to the Melvins’ typical downtempo grooves. “Flamboyant Duck” is a bit of an odd one – a light, airy tune with a prominent banjo lick and a swirling psychedelic section at the end. “Break Bread” might not be a cover, but it’s definitely got a 70’s rock vibe, and is the perfect length for an FM radio single.

And then there’s that Beatles cover. They definitely put their own spin on it, adding a nice, heavy riff to the mix, making it sound a little more like Weezer, albeit with more distortion, building up to a freaked-out, fuzz-pedal solo that definitely doesn’t sound like the Beatles. It still doesn’t beat their KISS cover of “Goin’ Blind” in my books. This song feels like a bit of novelty… but so does the rest of the album. I’m not sure if I’d even listen to any of this again.
