2018 is shaping up to have some epic releases within the metal world. For some reason **Mammoth Grinder** wasn’t on my radar, but I’m glad I found it. _Cosmic Crypt_ will be released on January 26th via Relapse Records; it’s the bands first release in five years, and it’s a good one.

Going into the album blind I wasn’t sure what to expect. I had heard of Mammoth Grinder before, but never actually heard them. Wow, I blame my friends for not introducing me to them sooner – what an awesome sound this band has.

Formed in Austin, Texas in the mid 2000s with members from Power Trip and Iron Regan, this metal trio of musicians have created a shredding sound that has this humble writer struggling to put it to words, but I will try. It’s like if you plucked all the fast, upbeat, fun aspects of great punk music and smashed it together with Cannibal Corpse or something along those lines... Talk about fun. What a rush.

_Cosmic Crypt_ is a relentless album full of fast riffs, killer solos, and some great sounding vocals. If fun aggressive music is your cup of tea, grab a cup and pull up a chair because this album is just that. A nonstop a thrill ride on the Death Metal express train that gives you no time to rest your neck, headbanging goodness in every sense of the word.

The good news is, you won’t have to wait to see these gentleman play live, be sure to catch them out on their North American tour which starts on February 2nd in Washington D.C. and ends March 3rd in Montclair NJ.
