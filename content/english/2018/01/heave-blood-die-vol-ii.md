Now, based on the band name you’re probably thinking I’m about to review a grindcore outfit, or maybe an uber-kvlt black metal brigade. Well no, not even close—although they _are_ from Norway. But their sound is far removed from the grim, frostbitten forest. Instead, they’re more akin to the Georgia prog-sludge of early Baroness or earlier Mastodon.

Their second album starts off with the heavy churn of “Plague,” a pretty decent mid-tempo tune with some head-nodding breakdowns. “Harakiri” slows things down, a catchy, seven-minute melodic sludge number complete with soaring keyboards. “Warsaw” has more of a Sleep/OM vibe, a chilled-out, down-tempo, vaguely oriental-sounding number (although the vocals lean closer to Scott Kelly of Neurosis), before they briskly pick up the pace past the three-minute mark, then take things into more spacey territory.

I’m digging the interplay between the synths and the doom riffs on “Countercult,” while “Wealth is Nothing” actually throws a couple of blasting black-metal passages into the mix. I guess they’re still Norwegian, after all.
