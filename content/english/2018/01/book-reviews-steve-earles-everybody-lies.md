### By Seth Stephens-Davidowitz

#### Foreword by Steven Pinker

It’s hard to get your head around the fact that on any given day the human race searching the internet amasses eight trillion gigabytes of data! Seth Stephens-Davidowitz is a Harvard-trained economist and worked as a data scientist for Google. As he reveals in this book, our digital footprint reveals that so much of what we think we know about ourselves is wrong.

The simple reason for this is, people lie all the time: on social media, in surveys, to professionals, to each other, and especially, we lie to ourselves. But in front of our computer keyboards, we tend to be more honest, and the huge amount of data produced by our internet searches reveals startling truths about the human race. We are not what we pretend to be.

A book like this would have been impossible twenty years ago, yet its findings are most important. By the time you have finished reading it, it will have changed the way you look at the world. There are few books you can say that about.
