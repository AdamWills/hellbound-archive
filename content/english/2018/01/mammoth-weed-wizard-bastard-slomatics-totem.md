You gotta love **Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard**. It’s like someone fired up a Random Doom Metal Name Generator, gave it a few spins, then picked their two favourites. What’s also cool about this band is that they sing in Welsh, although one of the titles of their two contributions to this split LP with UK stoner vets Slomatics is in English.

“The Master and His Emissary” kicks off Side A, a 12-and-a-half-minute epic that begins with two minutes of darkwave synth sounds before the first heavy riffs come in, crashing and lumbering like YOB or Neurosis. The soaring female vocals, which recall Mike Scheidt with a slightly sweeter edge, are fairly unintelligible—I’m not entirely sure that they’re singing in English.

“Eagduru” begins with a rumble, before kicking into another slow ‘n heavy doom riff that puts the “stoner” in stoner doom. The sickly sweet vocals, which soar above the mix, only accentuate the gloomy proceedings.

There are three tracks on the **Slomatics** side, starting with “Ancient Architects.” I know that Sons of OTIS are big fans of these guys, and you can certainly hear the sonic similarities in their airy, fuzzed-out doom with its similar pacing and pounding percussion. Interestingly enough, they follow this up with a four-minute piano interlude(!?) before getting back to the heavy stuff, with “Masters Descent,” an eight-minute tune that wouldn’t sound outta place on OTIS’ _Spacejumbofudge_, were it not for the synths and epic backing choir. I’m almost surprised they haven’t brought these guys across the pond yet…
