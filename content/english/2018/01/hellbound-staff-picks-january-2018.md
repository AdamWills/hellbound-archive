This year at Hellbound we've decided to revive an old tradition – our monthly staff picks/playlists! We've asked our regular and longtime contributors to weigh in on a few categories as follows (expect a few variations to our lists throughout the year, as well as some individual quirks and touches):

- **Listening to** - an album, ep or song from the library shelves (a pick that is _not_ new)
- **New release** - a worthy album, ep or song released within the past couple of months
- **Live** - a recently enjoyed live recording or gig
- **Non-metal** - an album, ep or song of choice from the non-metal world
- **Wild card** - a recommendation outside or beyond the above (any example of entertainment/infotainment/activity/cultural consumption/etc of note)

We hope you enjoy checking out our selections...

## Hellbound recommends:

### GRUESOME GREG

**Listening to:** Mighty High - _Legalize Tre Bags_ (Ripple Music) - Fun, catchy stoner-themed punk rock record!

**New release:** Coffin Torture - _Dismal Planet_ (Sludgelord Records)

**Live:** [COC/EHG at the Opera House](https://hellbound.ca/2018/01/amateur-concert-photography-hour-coc-ehg-pale-mare-ol-time-moonshine-opera-house-january-9-2018/) set the stage for 2018 for me. Looking forward to seeing [The Skull plays Trouble s/t at Hard Luck](https://www.facebook.com/events/2019913514921643/) and [Uriah freakin' Heap at The Phoenix](https://www.facebook.com/events/1642624709116842/) in the coming weeks!

**Non-metal:** Chris Stapleton - _Songs From A Room Vol. 1_ (I still haven't heard Vol. 2 yet)

**Wild card:** Looking forward to stuffing my face at [Winterlicious](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/festivals-events/winterlicious/) starting Jan 26!

### STEVE EARLES

**Listening to:** _Five Miles High_ - Mike Oldfield (Virgin). While not in the same class as Tubular Bells (what is?), still a great album, featuring the great Maggie Bell on vocals, and guest spots from Carl Palmer of ELP on drums, and Paddy Moloney of The Chieftains. What's not to like?

**New release:** Promo of the new Black Moth album _Anatomical Venus_ (New Heavy Sounds via Candlelight). This is heavy metal from a female perspective, with superb song-writing, and in Harriet Hyde, just the most sincere talented singer.

**Non-metal:** That has to The Cranberries' "Linger". So sad at the untimely death of Dolores O'Riordan this week. A kind sensitive talented soul, and a local girl to boot. Such a superb singer, especially live. You think as you get older you become immune to death, but her passing has put me, and much of Ireland in mourning. R.I.P Dolores; the light that burns brightest burns fastest.

**Wild Card:** _A Stitch In Time_ on BBC4. History through fashion, presented by the wonderful Amber Butchert, a baroque Emma Peel.

### JAY H. GORANIA

**Wild card:** Working on my band [Trench Warfare](https://trenchwarfaretx.bandcamp.com/)’s album.

### MATT HINCH
