When Udo Dirkschneider and company played [a two-hour set of Accept classics](https://hellbound.ca/2017/01/amateur-concert-photography-hour-dirkschneider-mod-club-january-10-2017/) here last year, it was one of my [favourite shows of 2017](https://hellbound.ca/2017/12/gruesome-gregs-top-15-concerts-2017/). At the time, I said I no longer needed to catch U.D.O. or Accept in concert again...but when I saw he was bringing back his namesake band for another kick of the can, I figured it was worth a repeat performance!

Mind you, they played a much different set this time around, digging deeper into the Accept catalogue and dusting off more obscure tunes like "The Beast Inside," "Another Second to Be" and "Can't Stand the Night" before closing the set with the title tracks from _Objection Overruled_ and _Russian Roulette_, respectively. This setlist would have been less satisfying for a more casual Accept fan, until they came back for an encore to play the songs everybody really wanted to hear: "Princess of the Dawn," "Metal Heart," "Fast as a Shark" and "Balls to the Wall." In the end, I don't think anyone was too disappointed.
