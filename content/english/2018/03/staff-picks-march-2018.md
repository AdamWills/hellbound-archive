This year we reintroduced an old Hellbound tradition – our monthly staff picks/playlists! Every few weeks we ask our regular and longtime contributors to weigh in on what they're listening to, watching, going to see... Expect a few quirks and idiosyncrasies now and then, but these are our standard staff pick categories:

- **Listening to** \- an album, ep or song from the library shelves (something that isn't new)
- **New release** \- a worthy album, ep or song released within the past couple of months
- **Live** - a recently enjoyed or highly anticipated live recording or gig
- **Non-metal** - an album, ep or song of choice from the non-metal world
- **Wild card** - a recommendation outside of or beyond the above picks

### Bianca Bobescu

**Listening to:** Dark Oath – _When Fire Engulfs The Earth, When Fire Engulfs The Earth_ (WormHoleDeath, 2016)

**New release:** Napalm Death – _Coded Smears And More Uncommon Slurs_ (Century Media, 30 March 2018)

**Non-metal:** Lorn – _Acid Rain_

### Steve Earles

**Listening to:** The Fall – _A_ _Past Gone Mad_. Mark E. Smith was a unique talent. The Fall released millions of albums (or so it seems!), and this is a good one. A band with a Joycean sense of lyrics (I always feel Mark was out to create the _Ulysses_ of post-punk!), and their own distinct sound. We live in a time when we are flooded with a multitude of useless, generic bands, using the internet and computer software to flood the world with their music (which could only happen in a world where people feel music should be free, and hence, like all things, what's given freely is frequently considered worthless). But The Fall are special, they did it their way, and they did it the hard way, and their music will always have worth.

**New release:** Vantablack Warship – _Abrasive Pulmonic Speak_. A band really coming into their own, one to watch.

**Live:** _24 Carat Purple_ by Deep Purple. A great live album, and it doesn't go on for centuries to outstay its welcome.

**Non-metal:** _The Essential Jefferson Airplane_. Really brilliant songs, and it also reminded me of Sanctuary's excellent cover of 'White Rabbit'. R.I.P. Warrel Dane.

**Wild card:** That would have to be the vinyl issue of '_Fuga Dal Bronx_' from Death Waltz records. This is the superb soundtrack to a film known in Ireland as _Bronx Warriors 2_, and elsewhere as _Escape From The Bronx_. An Italian rip-off of Mad Max and Escape From New York, this film is marvelous (and deserves a remake), and so is its soundtrack.

### Gene A. Gaona

**Listening to:** Dying Fetus - _Wrong One to Fuck With_ (Relapse, 2017)

**New release:** Haven't had much time in the last month to listen to much of anything new, so with that said I'm going to go with Philip H. Anselmo and The Illegals - _Choosing Mental Illness as a Virtue_.

**Live:** The Exhumed and Incantation show I recently attended was most excellent.

**Non-metal:** Pink - _Beautiful Trama_

**Wild card:** Educating my 14 year old son Benjamin on some classic movies lately: _Casino_, _Good Fellas_, _American Me_, and _Detroit Rock City_, just to name a few.

**Live:** I recently watched the HBO documentary _Eagles of Death Metal: Nos Amis (Our Friends)_ about the events before, during, and after the Bataclan terrorist attack and their return to Paris to play for the survivors. I can't imagine living through that.
