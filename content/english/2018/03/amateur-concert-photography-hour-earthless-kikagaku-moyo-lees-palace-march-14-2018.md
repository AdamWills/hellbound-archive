What's better than seeing Earthless live? How about seeing Earthless live with lava lights!? The San Diego heavy psych veterans brought their new album out on tour, along with some solid support from the land of the rising sun. I wasn't too familiar with [Kikagaku Moyo](https://geometricpatterns.bandcamp.com/) beforehand, but their psychedelic melodies came in all flavours from mellow to heavy to trippy. Plus, you gotta give props to any outfit that has a full-time sitar player!

Now, Earthless' new album has four songs with vocals and lyrics, which is highly unusual for them. They did play two of those songs this evening--but before and after that, they simply kicked out the cosmic jams we're accustomed to. And they were waaaay tripper with the light show, maaaan...
