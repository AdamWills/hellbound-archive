Earthless already has a couple opening acts lined up for their upcoming North American tour, but if they ever needed another one, they couldn’t do much better than this New York heavy psych trio. **River Cult** busts a groove and kicks out the jams for over 40 minutes here on their full-length debut.

“Likelihood of Confusion” kicks things off with a heavy, fuzzy, head-nodding riff right from the get-go, riding a slow, heavy 70’s groove for several minutes, before taking a swirling psychedelic turn for the final few. This is not an instrumental outfit, mind you—the first Fu Manchu stoner drawl comes about 1:30 into this seven-minute epic.

They follow it up with an even more extended cut, “The Sophist,” which lasts almost 12 minutes. The vocals are a little angrier and more aggressive, alongside a gritty verse that displays shades of Pentagram. This song swirls and swells around the four-minute mark, adding what certainly sounds like an organ to the mix, before mellowing out and picking up the tempo at the same time, flowing into a spaced-out, extended solo/jam section. The Earthless is strong with this one.

Airy seven-minute instrumental “Seething” starts off in post-rock territory, which only makes that first fuzzy doom riff all the more impactful when it kicks in about 2:30 in. From there, they move into more psychedelic jam territory, before ending in a swirl of feedback. The title track opens with a solid Sleepy bass line, kicking straight away into a heavy “Dragonaut” groove, then shows a bit more urgency on the chorus before ripping into a rollicking guitar solo, adding another one further down the line. These guys are definitely not afraid to jam… but sometimes, a little more structure might not hurt.
