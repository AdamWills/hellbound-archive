Both [Forming the Void](https://hellbound.ca/2017/02/forming-void-relic/) and [Pyreship](https://hellbound.ca/2017/04/pyreship-liars-bend-low/) put out awesome albums last year, so this split certainly seems fitting. Of course, this kind of (post) sludge is too long for a 7-inch, so while there are only two songs here, it still warrants a bigger piece of wax.

FTV takes Side A with “To the Wolves,” a six-and-a-half-minute mid-tempo stomper, with soaring vocal harmonies overtop a meaty fuzz-doom riff before an uber-heavy stop-start section around the 3-minute leads into some mellower stoner grooves. Nothing wrong with that at all.

Pyreship’s cut, “Wraith’s Tide,” is a little more left field. This nine-and-a-half-minute number starts off with a recorded speech by Nelson Mandela(?) taking its time in easing in to a more progressive post-sludge approach, before getting into a very Isis-y riff pattern a couple minutes in. From there, they alternate between mellower post-rock and a little more drive, with the same Isis riff making a repeat appearance. The vocals don’t even come in until past the six-minute mark!

While neither of these songs is absolutely amazing its own right, they should certainly tide us over until each outfit’s next full-length drops.
