It figures that just a few months after putting out their comeback album, which wound up being one of our top five Canadian releases of 2017, **Bison** would go all the way back to the beginning with this reissue of their first album on limited edition vinyl (666 copies). They’re more than 10 years removed from the original release of _Earthbound_, and their sound has certainly shifted since then… but it’s still worth checking out where these guys came from.

“Stokasaurus” starts things off with a big, clanging doom metal riff, before they kick into a mid-tempo groove reminiscent of Red Fang (who themselves were just getting their feet wet at the time), with a couple heavy breakdowns thrown in for good measure. “Wartime” picks up the pace with an up-tempo attack off the top more akin to High on Fire. But then a stomping stop-start riff first kicks in after 90 seconds, after which they slow things down considerably. “Dark Skies Above” borders on thrash metal with its aggressively picked riffing, while “The Curse” was practically pulled from Down’s playbook (with shades of forgotten T.O. rockers Diablo Red).

Then again, it can definitely be said that this still sounds like the Bison we all know and love. Listening to _Earthbound_, you can definitely see why Metal Blade would soon come a calling…
