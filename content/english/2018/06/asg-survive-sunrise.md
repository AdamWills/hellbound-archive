Now, I don’t think that “sludge pop” is actually a thing, although I might have seen that term used in a Torche review or two. It could also possibly apply to **ASG**, a Carolina outfit that often mixes catchy hooks with heavy, distorted riffs. It’s been five years since their last album, _[Blood Drive](https://hellbound.ca/2013/06/asg-blood-drive/)_, which landed somewhere on my top list for 2013, and I only caught a [brief glimpse of ‘em in Vegas](https://hellbound.ca/2016/09/psycho-las-vegas-day-three-recap/) two years ago, so at this point, I’m ready to give that sludge pop another lick, erm, listen…

They do try to make up for lost time by packing 13 tracks into 50 minutes here, including one “digital bonus” track at the end. The title track starts us off with a nice melodic guitar run, before a wave of distortion comes in along with the high-pitched vocals. Kylesa might be the first name that comes to mind—though they’re not really derivative, they do share a certain melodic sensibility. The vocals and chugging riffs of “Execution Thirst” actually made me think of Billy Talent, but these guys do throw in a couple post-chorus breakdowns to cleanse the palate. And there’s nothing melodic or pop-punky about the black-metal wails that appear throughout “Up From My Dreams.” I’m digging the slow, doomy section around the two-minute mark, too!

“Lightning Song” is a solid slice of southern doom à la King Giant, while “Hawks on the Run” intersperses a mellow verse with some heavy, doomy breakdowns. And the opening riff to “The Heaven Moon” simply crushes. On the more melodic side, the chorus of “God Knows We (Don’t Mean Well)” is soaring and uplifting, in spite of its message—ditto the incredibly catchy chorus of “Heavy Scars.” And “Lamb Song” shows that light, airy breakdowns can be a thing. And that digital bonus track “Tied Tongues” makes seeking out this album in a digital format worthwhile.
