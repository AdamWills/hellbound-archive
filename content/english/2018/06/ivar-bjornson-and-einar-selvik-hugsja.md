The previous collaboration from Ivar Bjørnson of Enslaved and Einar Selvik of Wardruna, _Skuggsjá_, was both an achievement and a success (though you would expect nothing less from such individuals). Follow-up _Hugsjá_ is, simply put, a beautiful piece of music, one that works perfectly well as a body of work.

The word _Hugsjá_ means to see within or with the mind. It means listening to the inner voice that is more and more frequently drowned by modern life. I found, quite simply, that the album indeed is an inner journey, and it conjured in my mind images of Vikings, fjords, coastal landscapes… of timeless space and freedome.

Just superb, I defy anyone with a heart to listen to _Hugsjá_ and not be moved. It is truly a beautiful and epic work, one you hear with your heart as much as your mind.
