Germany's Dust Bolt was set to join last year's "Battle of the Bays" tour, featuring Obituary, Exodus and Power Trip. They did join, but belatedly â€“ visa troubles. Happily, North Americans had a second chance to catch Dust Bolt opening for Obituary this spring. And Hellbound's Gene Gaona was there, in San Francisco, to catch the bands in action.
