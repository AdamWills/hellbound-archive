It’s been six years since we’ve had new music from **Ancestors**, a proggy post-sludge outfit that’s apparently gone from a quintet to a three-piece in the process. Not only have they slimmed down their lineup, but they also seem to have trimmed the fat. While [2012’s _In Dreams and Time_](https://hellbound.ca/2012/07/ancestors-in-dreams-and-time/) featured six tracks spanning 66 minutes, this one contains the same number of songs in a much more compact 36:30.

“Gone” starts things off with six minutes of slow, heavy, melodies with more of an airy, post-rock feel and a chill instrumental section that straddles the five-minute mark and flows perfectly into “Through a Window,” which gives off a bit of a Pink Floyd vibe—especially in the vocal department. And even with the slimmed-down lineup, it seems like they’ve kept the organ on this one.

At over seven-and-a-half minutes, “Lying in the Grass” is much more mellow. They even use a vocoder right from the get-go. The first heavy riff kicks in just past the three-minute mark with a chorus that’s equal parts Neurosis and HIM (yes, the Finnish “love metal” outfit). It’s also followed by a whispered spoken-word interlude and an airy, shoegaze guitar solo. “Into The Fall” goes one step further, incorporating church bells and a string section. Isis or Neurosis never did anything like this!
