Good music is always timeless music and such is the case with the music made by the splendidly named **The Raz**. Their self-titled debut could have been recorded at any time in the last fifty years (which I mean as the highest compliment). Their musicianship is very strong and the band gel together well, giving them a very organic sound. They are clearly a band who, as Jack Burton in _Big Trouble in Little China_ might say, have "paid their dues" (“The cheque is in the mail”).

The songs of The Raz are excellent and a pleasure to listen it; it’s as though their songs have always been there. The production and mixing are excellent too. And I love the artwork by Josh Wiley, it really fits the music, and it shows a righteous commitment to the physical form of music.

All in all, anyone who appreciates good rock music will love this.
