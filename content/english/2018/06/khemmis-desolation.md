It’s not uncommon for a more traditional doom band to take a turn toward power metal—Argus first made strides in this direction with _Boldly Strides the Doomed_, while Age of Taurus is leaning much more towards the swords ‘n sorcery set on their outstanding second album, _[The Colony Slain](https://hellbound.ca/2018/05/age-of-taurus-the-colony-slain/)_. We can also now include Khemmis in this conversation. The Denver doomsters, whose [first two albums](https://hellbound.ca/2015/07/khemmis-absolution/) were very [reminiscent of Pallbearer](https://hellbound.ca/2016/11/khemmis-hunted/), have upped the tempos and added some galloping trad metal riffs here on _Desolation_, their best release to date.

The album begins with an Iron Maiden-esque riff on “Bloodletting.” The vocals still remind me of Pallbearer, while the faster drumming on the verses leads into a slow, ‘n heavy chorus. This is a prime example of power doom. Some nice breakdowns on this six-and-a-half-minute number—they actually kick it up into mid-paced thrash territory for a spirited solo around the five-minute mark. Pre-release single “Isolation” is a compact 4:48, and the shimmering opening riff could have been taken from Argus—or maybe even Blind Guardian. The longing vocals soar a little higher on this more upbeat number, and suit the overall theme quite nicely.

“Flesh to Nothing” is a head-nodding mid-tempo stomp that stretches to seven and a half minutes, throwing in a couple of pretty lugubrious passages along the way. There’s even a full-out black-metal section, complete with garbled vocals, around the five-minute mark. “The Seer” might be the closest track to their Pallbearer-infused past, but at this point in the album, it’s a welcome change of pace. “Maw of Time” brings back the power-metal chug despite its slower pace, complete with a more aggressive chorus vocal and a super-heavy sludge section about five minutes in.

At nine-and-a-half minutes, “From Ruin” ends the album on a slower, heavier note. This one falls somewhere between Pallbearer and Argus, and includes a minimalistic, vocal-driven section that starts around 2:30 until a heavy trad doom riff comes in a minute later. They pick up the pace to full-fledged power metal ahead of a traditionally true-metal guitar solo, before veering back toward Pallbearer for a melodic, melancholic finish.
