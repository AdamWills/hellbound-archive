It’s been a while since **Witch Mountain** parted ways with Uta Plotkin, the amazingly rangy singer who first blew my mind on [2011’s _South of Salem_](https://hellbound.ca/2011/05/witch-mountain-south-of-salem/). But their next two albums were subsequently less heavy, before creative differences led to the search for a new frontwoman. And while it didn’t take long for the band to welcome Kayla Dixon into the fold, we’ve all been waiting a while—over three years—for their first post-Plotkin release.

Now, I did get a chance to see this lineup live in late 2016, [opening for Saint Vitus](https://hellbound.ca/2016/10/amateur-concert-photography-hour-saint-vitusthe-skullwitch-mountain-grog-shop-cleveland-october-8-2016/), and I was pretty impressed with a set consisting mostly of new material. So I’ve had some pretty high hopes for this one before I even pressed play. Can they rise to the occasion?

Witch Mountain s/t is almost an EP, with five songs in just over 36 minutes—and it ends on a 14-minute epic track. “Midnight” kicks things off with a heavy, gurgling, downtuned doom riff, before the vocals come in, just as stirring as before, hitting some of the same notes, but with maybe a bit more bite. The more vicious vocal approach suits the heavy riffs quite nicely. “Mechanical World” combines a stop-start riff with a soaring vocal, before throwing in a bluesy doom breakdown around the 1:30 mark. From there the song gets slower, while maintaining the same jagged approach until it devolves into a melodic vocal line backed by a military-style snare around the three-minute mark. This is definitely not Doom-by-Numbers!

At nearly eight minutes, “Burn You Down” takes on some more typical doomy tempos, although the soulful vocals are definitely a distinguishing factor. I do like the more mid-paced riff that kicks in at the start of the chorus, giving off a Gates of Slumber vibe, and the death-metal vocals that kick in past the five-minute mark signal a more grittier direction. From there, they go full vintage soul on “Hellfire,” a two-and-a-half-minute interlude that leads us to the grand finale.

The 14:40 anthem “Nighthawk” actually opens with a bass solo, before it’s joined by a screaming guitar. The banana-slug tempos of this number might be the most reminiscent of their 2011 come-out-of-nowhere comeback effort, albeit with a softer touch and a bluesier vibe, and a bit of a blackened metal passage just shy of the 12-minute mark. I don’t think they’ve ever gone on this long before, either.

This album is definitely different than their previous material. It’s heavier in spots, but also a little more eccentric. It’s certainly not a return to _South of Salem_, but I can still dig it.
