So much metal is marred by a lack of dynamics, but that is certainly not the case with **Sense of Fear**. Time changes abound on _As The Ages Passing By…_, giving Sense of Fear a real sense of drama.

The first thing that struck me about Sense of Fear was their strong songwriting and musicality. The second was that they are not afraid to let their songs breathe naturally; they have clearly studied hard at the altars of the metal greats that have come before. I detected influences from Down, At The Gates, Pantera, Motorhead, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest, all mixed in their own creative cauldron, creating a strong modern metal sound that would appeal to fans of the above bands.
