There is an important and very true quote from Carl Jung in the CD booklet to Cancer’s excellent _Shadow Gripped_, which I will share with you.

“It is a frightening thought that man also has a shadow side to him, consisting not just of little weaknesses and foibles, but of a positively demonic dynamism. The individual seldom knows anything of this; to him, as an individual, it is incredible that he should ever in any circumstances go beyond himself. But let these harmless creatures form a mass, and there emerges a raging monster; and each individual is only one tiny cell in the monster’s body, so that for better or worse he must accompany if on its bloody rampages and even assist it to the utmost. Having a dark suspicion of these grim possibilities, man turns a blind eye to the shadow-side of human nature. Blindly he strives against the salutary dogma of original sin, which is yet so prodigiously true. Yes, he even hesitates to admit the conflict of which he is so painfully aware.”

As you see from the above quote, Cancer display an insight and intelligence that escapes many bands.

Musically, Cancer being on Peaceville is a perfect fit, and they have delivered an excellent dynamic set of songs, moving forward, whilst staying true to their roots.

Death metal as it should be!
