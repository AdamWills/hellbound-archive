## Behemoth with At The Gates and Wolves In The Throne Room @ The Danforth Music Hall - Toronto, ON - 6 November 2018

What could honestly be a better lineup? Wolves in the Throne Room, At the Gates and Behemoth were absolutely all amazing and seeing as it was my first time witnessing Behemoth, I was in love. Their stage show is breathtaking with fog shows and intricate costumes but obviously some amazing music. I'd have to say they're even better live. It was definitely one of my favorite shows of the year! Can't wait to see them again!
