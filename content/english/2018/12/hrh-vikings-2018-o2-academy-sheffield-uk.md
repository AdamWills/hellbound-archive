## HRH Vikings 2018, December 1-2 at O2 Academy in Sheffield, UK

Welcome to Asgard! HRH Vikings is a brand new addition to the Hard Rock Hell cycle... well, kind of a new addition – it is replacing HRH NWOBHM's traditional Heavy Metal sounds with five metal subgenres: Battle, Nordic, Pagan, Black and Death Metal.

The highly anticipated festival's first edition took place on December 1st and 2nd at O2 Academy in Sheffield, United Kingdom, hosting in the two days over 20 bands on two stages.

Saturday's headliners were no other than Finnish folk metallers **Turisas**. On Sunday the same duty went to Faroese quartet _**Týr**._
