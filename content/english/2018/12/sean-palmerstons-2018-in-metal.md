## Album Cover of the Year

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dy8mxogvn/image/upload/v1545936028/a4057307414_16.jpg)

YOB - _Our Raw Heart_ 2LP (Relapse)

I love the entire packaging for the new YOB album. The design – by Orion Landau – is super cool, especially on the gatefold LP.

## Best Gig of 2018

Judas Priest / Saxon / Black Star Riders - Masonic Temple Theatre, Detroit MI, March 31 2018

I started a new job early on this year and didn’t get out to as many shows as I would have liked, but no matter how many I went to this would have been close to the top. A great triple bill of classic bands, with Saxon absolutely stealing the show away from the mighty Judas Priest.

## Favourite Physical Item Purchased

My favourite album that I bought is also my number one album of the year. Voivod’s _The Wake_ is hands down the best album that came out this year. What a masterpiece!

## Most Anticipated Album(s) of 2019

I am not truly caught up yet on 2018, so I haven’t been looking ahead to 2019 yet. Sad but true.

## My 2018 in Metal

My year in metal consisted of a lot of Voivod. More Voivod than you could probably imagine. Thirty years after I fell in love with _Dimension Hatross_ they won over my heart once again. Who knew?

## Looking Forward To in 2019

Seeing Asphyx at Quebec Deathfest in September.

## Metal Person of the Year

Sarah Kitteringham is my metal person of the year. A former Hellbound contributor, since her move to Toronto Ms. Kitteringham has fully immersed herself in the city’s metal scene and has been busy on all fronts. Not only is she doing video reviews for Banger TV, she’s also writing reviews as a staff member for Bandcamp.com and also fronting her own trad metal outfit [Smoulder](https://smoulder.bandcamp.com/), who released their debut cassette earlier this year. She’s living the dream and loving every minute of it. I couldn’t be more happy for her!
