## Striker – Play To Win

Striker remind me of the good old days when great bands like Iron Maiden released a new (and brilliant!) album every year. Striker are very much in that mould. The excellent _Play To Win_ is their third album in three years. Third time lucky! Once again, superb performance, great songs, and a pure love of metal in the most positive way. I love this album and if you love metal so will you.

## Jo Quail – Exsolve

One of the nice things about reviewing music is that occasionally you will be sent something to review that completely floors you in its originality. Such an album is Jo Quail’s _Exsolve_. Produced by metal mastermind Chris Fielding (Conan, Electric Wizard and more), Jo is a virtuoso cellist and composer who has toured with likes of Boris and Myrkur (a collaboration between those two artists would be a joy to hear). Jo’s music is emotive, haunting and above all original. I recommend it strongly to anyone who likes the above qualities in the music they listen to.

(Self-Release)
