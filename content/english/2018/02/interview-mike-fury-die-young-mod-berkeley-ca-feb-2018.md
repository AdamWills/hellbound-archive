Hellbound's Gene A. Gaona met up with drummer Mike Fury recently, while **Die Young** was on tour in the American south west. Mike and Gene talk about the new Die Young release _The God for Which We Suffer_ (out January 26 via Good Fight Music), touring, and the evolution of Die Young's sound, before shifting gears to talk about MOD and a few "fan"-submitted questions.
