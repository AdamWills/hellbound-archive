Last month we reintroduced an old Hellbound tradition – our monthly staff picks/playlists! We’ve asked our regular and longtime contributors to weigh in on a few categories as follows (expect a few variations to our lists throughout the year, as well as some individual quirks and touches):

- **Listening to** – an album, ep or song from the library shelves (a pick that is _not_ new)
- **New release** – a worthy album, ep or song released within the past couple of months
- **Live** – a recently enjoyed live recording or gig
- **Non-metal** – an album, ep or song of choice from the non-metal world
- **Wild card** – a recommendation outside or beyond the above (any example of entertainment/infotainment/activity/culture/etc of note)

## HELLBOUND RECOMMENDS

### Bill Adams

**Listening to:** The Beach Bullies - _We Stole The Universe_ LP (Manufactured Records). This one’s the most recent project by former Containers front man James Smith. In keeping with fresh start releases, _We Stole The Universe_ features a few re-workings of material from Smith’s previous projects (including The Containers), but presented with a new coat of paint applied and more than a few new lessons learned. Of course, the stars of the show are the new songs which were written specifically for this album, but each of the pieces fits together so well that, before long, listeners just relish in the album as a whole rather than fussing over when the songs originated.

**New Release:** Lemuria - _Recreational Hate_ LP (Turbo Worldwide/Asian Man Records). I got hooked on this album on my very first play through it (writing a review now, actually), and have been unable to put it down since it arrived on my doorstep. Between the beautiful vocal melodies set up by singer/guitarist Sheena Ozzella and the songs penned by drummer/singer Alex Kerns (many of which have the tag "future standards" displayed prominently), the album is just bursting with instantly hummable melodies and instantly memorable song craft. Better still, not one song EVER GETS OLD or begins to feel overplayed, no matter how often one runs through the album (believe me — I’d have found one by now).

**Wild Card:** _Attack of the Killer Tomatoes_ DVD/Blu-Ray reissue, MVD. Say what you want, I’m still as hopelessly in love with _Attack of the Killer Tomatoes_ now as I was when I saw it in 1984. The new DVD/Blu-Ray set features re-touched sound and gorgeous visuals which honestly improve the experience, rather than simply elevating the set’s price point.

### Adrien Begrand

**Listening to / new releases:** Primordial, _Exile Amongst the Ruins_ (Metal Blade), Tribulation, _Down Below_ (Century Media), Visigoth, _Conqueror's Oath_ (Metal Blade), Greber, _Cemetery Preston_ (Pink Lemonade)

**Non-metal:** Jóhann Jóhannsson (RIP), _Fordlândia_ (4AD)

**Wildcards:** Reading - _Anna Karenina_, by Leo Tolstoy. Watching - _The Devil's Backbone_ (Guillermo del Toro, dir.)

### Steve Earles

**Listening to:** Ozzy Osbourne's _No More Tears_. It makes me wish we still had a paying public buying records, as this is the kind of well produced metal album we miss, and that title track is epic. It would be sad if the Double-O never made another studio album, but I fear that will be the case.

**New release:** Corrosion of Conformity's _No Cross, No Crown_. now there is a title to live by, a plea for a civilized secular world, free from patriarchal religious domination; the music more than backs up its lofty ideas and ideals. COC have always had what so many bands lack: sincerity and songs. At a time when so many artists of their era are milking an ever-decreasing 'farewell' circuit, COC are here for all the right reasons and deserve our support.

**Live:** Rory Gallagher - _BBC Sessions_: a two-CD set, one live, one in the studio, and even the studio one is live and dangerous. Just the most beautiful, heavy and heartfelt music, love it.

**Wild Card:** Last Saturday I watched an excellent film called [_Suffragette_ on Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/suffragette), staring Carey Mulligan. Just the most moving film; every man should watch it to get an insight into what women have and still do endure. It is a film that changes how you look at the world and not many films can you say that about.

### Gene A. Gaona

**Listening to:** Harlott ~ _Extinction_, Killer Bay Area sounding thrash band from the Land Down Under.

**New release:** Genocide Pact ~ _Order of Torment_, Relapse Records out February 2.

**Live:** Obituary ~ _Ten Thousand Ways To Die_ (Live Album)

**Non-metal:** Canned Heat’s Greatest Hits

**Wild card:** Super Bowl 52, one of the most entertaining Super Bowls I can remember. It was also an excellent example of why the NFL is the greatest sport known to man. What a game!
