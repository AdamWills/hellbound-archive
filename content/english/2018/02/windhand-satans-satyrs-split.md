Although they offer very different takes on what you might file under doom, they’re both at the top of their game. Windhand and Satan’s Satyrs put on a [great gig in Toronto](https://hellbound.ca/2017/05/amateur-concert-photography-hour-windhandsatans-satyrs-horseshoe-tavern-may-19-2017/) while touring together last year, and now they’ve teamed up again on this 31-minute split EP.

Although **Windhand** only gets two songs to their fellow Virginians’ three, they actually take up twice as much runtime on here. “Old Evil” is relatively brisk by Windhand’s standards, clocking in at a shade over six minutes. The fuzzy, crunchy opening riff sounds like something I’ve heard before (in the live setting, perhaps?), before they settle in to their signature sludge/doom stomp. Heads will be banging, most definitely.

“Three Sisters” is a much more epic track, nearly 14 minutes on the nose. This one features some eerie church bell keyboard effects alongside one wicked and nasty trad-doom riff, before giving way to an eerie, vocal-driven verse. This one almost resembles funeral doom in its pacing, or perhaps even the song “Black Sabbath” from the album _Black Sabbath_ by the artist Black Sabbath.

The pace picks up to a mid-tempo jaunt on the **Satan’s Satyrs** side, with the groovy, 80’s British metal stylings of “Alucard AD 2018.” “Succubus” kicks things up another notch, adding a dash of Pentagram to the mix. And “Ain’t That Lovin’ You Baby” is a cover of a 1950’s Jimmy Reed blues number with a twist that recalls The Stones from the 70’s…y’know, back when they didn’t suck.

Despite the contrast in styles, this is still a satisfying listen.
