## A step back in musical time

If you've ever wanted to hear the Nordic past summoned into the present, **Wardruna** is a band you don't want to sleep on. Perhaps you've heard them already. Wardruna have released a trilogy of albums: _Runaljod – gap var Ginnunga_ (2009), _Runaljod – Yggdrasil_ (2013), and _Runaljod – Ragnarok_ (2016). Their music has featured in the television series _Vikings_. And maybe you've listened to composer/multi-instrumentalist Einar Kvitrafn Selvik in Gorgoroth, Sahg, or one of the other metal bands he's been involved with.

But unlike Gorgoroth or Sahg, Wardruna is not extreme metal. Musically, the group summons the past through the sound of old Nordic instruments and rhythm of old Nordic poetic metres. Wardruna harken back lyrically as well, combining Norwegian with Old Norse and Proto-Norse. The result is often haunting, sometimes mesmerizing.

If you're lucky enough to have a ticket to one of a few Canadian and American tour dates, you'll be able to experience Wardruna live as well. The band that once performed in front of the 1100-year-old Gokstad ship at the Viking Ship Museum in Norway just embarked on their first North American tour. Only the [final show in Toronto](https://www.facebook.com/events/1718113078219123/) has yet to sell out, and I expect it's only a matter of time.
