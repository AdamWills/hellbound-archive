Exmortus recently had the chance to join Sabaton and Kreator for a few shows in the U.S. and our Mean Gene Gaona grabbed the chance to speak with Jadran 'Conan' Gonzalez in the hours leading up their final date in Berkeley, California. Gene and Conan chat live shows, new music, the Exmortus sound, NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) and more.
