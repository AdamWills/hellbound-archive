## Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams

### Written by Matthew Walker

#### Published by Allen Lane

It was always thought that the three pillars of health were diet, exercise and sleep. But that was wrong: sleep should always come first – it is irrefutably the foundation the other two pillars are built on.

This fine book was Waterstones Book of the Month January 2018, which doesn’t surprise me (but does please me as this is a most important book). This is an extremely accessible book on an extremely important subject. Like Ruby Wax’s recent and excellent _How to Be Human_ (explaining the workings of the human mind, the benefits of mindfulness, etc.), _Why We Sleep_ explains the crucial nature of sleep. It’s been a terribly neglected subject, for sleep is of paramount importance for our mental and physical wellbeing.

If you only buy two books this year, make this one, and make the other [Ruby Wax’s _How to Be Human_](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/303975/how-to-be-human-the-manual/).
