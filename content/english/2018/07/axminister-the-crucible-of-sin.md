**AxMinister** have arisen like vengeful wraiths from the frozen tundra of Ontario to save the metal world from trends! Founded in 1999, this power-trio are metal for life, and it shows. _The Crucible of Sin_ is a great thrash/traditional metal album, showing strong influences from Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Slayer and Metallica to full effect. The production is excellent, playing and songs are strong, and you just have to love that cover artwork.
