Join us as we combine two Hellbound traditions – our monthly staff picks and our annual Canada Day feature! Every few weeks this year we've asked our contributors to weigh in on what they’re listening to, watching, going to see… This month we carry on with the usual categories, but we've added a Canadian twist.

## Hellbound recommends: the Canadian edition

### Danielle Griscti

**Listening to:**

Spectral Wound - _Infernal Decadence_ (Vendetta Records - June 2nd). Black metal diamond in the rough, from Montréal.

**New release:**

Délétère - _De Horae Leprae_ (Sepulchral Prod, June 15th). Solid, fast-paced offering from this mysterious Québec City duo with a penchant for atmosphere.

**Live:**

Völur at Coalition (May 29th). These trailblazers returned to the stage more energetic and spellbinding than ever. Angelic passages were punctuated by banshee screams amid their now well-established backdrop. Of note is their touring lineup included a new drummer, who filled in (heh) perfectly here.

**Non-metal:**

Grand Analog - _Survival_ (January 26th). Warm and fuzzy danceability defines this refreshing hip-hop quintet. Perfect for taking things down a notch or while your morning coffee brews. \[bandcamp width=100% height=120 album=1576955022 size=large bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 tracklist=false artwork=small\] [grandanalog.bandcamp.com/album/survival-ep](https://grandanalog.bandcamp.com/album/survival-ep)

**Wild card:**

Wilt - _Ruin_ (May 18th). So pretty. Doomy, sad, and pretty.

### Matt Hinch

**Listening to:**

Cancer Bats discography. With the release of their new album I've been blasting my way through all their work. They sound like summer to me anyway. Hail Destroyer!!!!

**New release:**

Wilt - _Ruin_. Atmospheric and vile black metal from the frigid (in Winter) province of Manitoba. Mosquitos can cause that kind of anguish as well.

**Live:** Haven't seen anything lately but I have my ticket for Cancer Bats in Kingston this September! Stoked!

**Wild card:** My oldest daughter just graduated Grade 8. She wore purple Converse high-tops to her grad ceremony. That's pretty cool!

### Daniel Smith

**Canadian pick:** MorMor - _Heaven's Only Wishful_ EP (Don't Guess, 2018). A beautiful R&B, psych-pop debut EP from Toronto local, Seth Nyquist.
