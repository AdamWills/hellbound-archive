In an ever-changing universe, one thing that is pleasingly consistent is a new **Fu Manchu** album; it is as though this album was always with us, like some 70s stoner artifact. Fuzzy riff and grooves abound, and tracks like "Slower Than Light," "Don’t Panic," and the title track will please long-term Fu-fans. Interestingly though, the final track, "Il Mostro Atomico," is 18 minutes long, and features a certain Alex Lifeson of Rush – which is a glowing endorsement that Fu Manchu are doing things the way they should be.
