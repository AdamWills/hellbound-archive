Join us as we continue with this revived Hellbound tradition – our monthly staff picks/playlists. Every few weeks we ask our regular and longtime contributors to weigh in on what they’re listening to, watching, going to see… Expect a few quirks and idiosyncrasies now and then, but these are our standard staff pick categories:

**Listening to** – an album, ep or song from the library shelves (something that isn’t new) **New release** – a worthy album, ep or song released within the past couple of months **Live** – a recently enjoyed or highly anticipated live recording or gig **Non-metal** – an album, ep or song of choice from the non-metal world **Wild card** – a recommendation outside of or beyond the above picks

## HELLBOUND RECOMMENDS

### Bianca Bobescu

**Listening to:** Septicflesh – _Codex Omega_ (Season of Mist, 2017)

**New release:** Parkway Drive – _Reverence_ (Epitaph)

**Live:** Hellfest Open Air ([www.hellfest.fr](http://www.hellfest.fr/))

**Non-metal:** Zaz – "Je veux"

**Wild card:** reading – _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ by Ken Kesey

### Steve Earles

**Listening to:** _Deepest Purple: The Very Best of Deep Purple_. So many bands today have no songs; not Purple, a masterclass in what heavy music should be.

**New Release:** Sleep – _The_ _Sciences_ (Third Man Records). Heavier than a dwarf star, Sleep are metal without any of its weaknesses.

**Live:** Pink Floyd – _Live At Pompeii_ (1973). Far out!

**Non Metal:** _Drive_ soundtrack by Cliff Martinez (2011). Excellent synthwave soundtrack.

**Wild Card:** _Solo: A Star Wars Story_ (2018). Made with innocence, despite being set in outer space it reminded me of Indiana Jones, heroic and exciting I recommend it highly. Form your own opinion; don't rely on others.

**New release:** Sleep – _The Sciences_ (Third Man Records, green vinyl)

**Non-metal:** Thanks to a Videostream ad for _Super Troopers 2_ I've had Abba's "Super Trouper" (1980) chiming on and off in my brain for a couple of weeks.
