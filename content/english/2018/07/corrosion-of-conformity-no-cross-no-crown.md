After two albums with the classic three-piece line-up of Woody Weatherman on guitars and vocals, Mike Dean on bass and vocals, and Reed Mullin on drums, **Corrosion of Conformity** have reunited with legendary vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan!

Instantly we are back in _Deliverance_ territory with strong, heavy and sincere songs. COC’s music comes from the heart, from experience, and it reflects the world around; COC are more relevant than ever. Even the title _No Cross, No Crown_ is a statement of intent, the band having seen those words on a stained glass window in a deconsecrated church in Colchester.

Another factor in this being a consistently good COC album is the production by long-term cohort John Custer. Every track means something, and they stand up well alongside the songs of _Blind_, _Deliverance_, _Wiseblood_ and _In The Arms of God_.

An album that really belongs in the record collection of everyone who loves quality music.
