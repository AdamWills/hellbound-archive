## ![](https://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/David-Bowie-in-Darkness-cover.jpg)A Study of _1\. Outside_ and the Late Career

### Written by Nicholas P. Greco

There are probably more books written about David Bowie covering the period from _Space Oddity_ to _Ashes to Ashes_ than the later stages of his career, as these were so long considered his ‘Golden Years’. Yet Bowie always created interesting music, none more so than what he produced in the final stages of his career, which is the area covered by this well-researched and intriguing book.

To my mind, Bowie’s later career explores not just his own inner psyche but the world at large from the perspective of The Outsider. I think he observed and understood that, with the rise of social media and electronic communication, the individual would become far more individual than is good for them. This is a time of electronic isolation, a time of ghosting, and there is much food for thought in Bowie’s later work.

Bowie’s guitarist Reeves Gabrels provided information for the author, contributing to what makes this a valuable book for Bowie fans and scholars alike.

Overall, a worthy addition to the canon of work about Bowie’s art.
