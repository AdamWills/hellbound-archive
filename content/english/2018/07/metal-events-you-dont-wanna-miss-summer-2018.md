June ended and July began with one of the great international festivals: TUSKA (29.6.–1.7.2018 | SUVILAHTI, HELSINKI) and METALOCALYPSTICK 2018, a Western Canadian festival celebrating heavy metal and embracing the power of women in metal, punk and rock (June 30 - July 1 | [metalocalypstickfest.rocks](http://metalocalypstickfest.rocks/)). Here we list some of the notable metal events scheduled throughout the rest of the summer.
