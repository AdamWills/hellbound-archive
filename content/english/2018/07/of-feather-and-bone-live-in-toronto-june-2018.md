## 6/26/2018 @ Coalition T.O - Toronto, ON w/ Tomb Mold

At Coalition, **Of Feather and Bone** truly delivered a terrifying performance. _Bestial Hymns of Perversion_, their second full-length record, was played from start to finish with extreme talent. Alvino on bass and vocals, Preston on drums and Dave on guitars and vocals all delivered amazing performances, in a blood-tipped red light. It was quite the treat to see one of the greatest death metal albums of the year being played in the dark from beginning to end. Tomb Mold, the supporters of OFAB have also just released a brilliant death metal album entitled, _Manor of Infinite Forms_ on 20 Buck Spin. They were also amazing to see live and this was definitely my favorite death show I've seen in Toronto to date!
