Anywhere there’s high levels of violence and poverty, sludge metal often isn’t far behind. Listed as the [Number 4 Murder Capital of America](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/blog/highest-murder-rate-cities), ahead of Baltimore, Detroit and Compton, St. Louis definitely fits the bill (the suburb of East St. Louis is actually Number 1), and its native sons **Fister** display plenty of downtrodden aggression on their latest album, _No Spirit Within_.

With seven tracks clocking in just under 49-minutes, this isn’t a drive-by shooting, either. After a two-minute spaghetti western intro, the brutal beating begins with “Disgraced Possession,” a nearly 10-minute slice of vicious, oozing death doom à la Primitive Man, with a bit of a black-metal twist. “Cazador” takes things even slower with a heavy-hitting Japanese assault à la Coffins or Corrupted for the first two minutes, before settling into a mid-paced groove that could be considered hardcore punk—were it not for the bilious, vomitus black-metal vocals. Around the three-minute mark, it devolves into a series of slow, heavy breakdowns that might lead to permanent spinal damage. Speaking of Japan, the rugged grooves of “I Am Kuru” give me a bit of a Church of Misery vibe.

The 12-minute title track is bleak, gritty and slow moving, before a d-beat drum pattern signals a shift into a blackened hardcore pattern about four minutes in. Once again, it’s only temporary, lasting a minute or so until the downtuned despondency returns.
