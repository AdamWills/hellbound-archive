**Paradise Lost**’s career has been plagued by changes in sound and direction. You could see this as band-wagon jumping, or fearlessly following their own musical muse. You can decide what you think; it’s good to make your own mind up.

What is certain is this. Circa _Icon_, Paradise Lost stood a very good chance of becoming a Gothic metal version of Metallica. However, albums like _One Second_ and _Host_ took them away from this, and the band suffered commercially for it. The follow-up to this has been a gradual return to elements of their old sound. Again, you can make your own mind up about their reasons for doing so.

_Believe In Nothing_ was originally released in 2000, and would have fitted in with the Gothic metal of the time that Paradise Lost had done so much to inspire. At times _Believe In Nothing_ reminds me of Lacuna Coil, is not because Paradise Lost were copying them, but because in the intervening years, that sound has become ubiquitous.

I never heard this album before this re-release (actually I was unaware of its existence) so I cannot comment on the remix and remaster though, it sounds very clear and sharp. Some of the Depeche Mode-isms that inspired or blighted, _Host_, depending on your opinion, are still present, though no way near as much. What _Believe In Nothing_ does have going for it are the strength of its songs and the quality of musicianship.

In some alternative universe Paradise Lost are bigger than Metallica. In this one? Well, they’re a ground-breaking respected band, still making music, and celebrating three decades in a harsh business. I’d say that makes them special indeed.
