As a lifetime fan of metal, very few things or bands truly get me excited about new releases. I mean, when you grew up listening to the birth/early stages of Thrash and Death Metal the bar has been set pretty high, and today’s music usually seems too often to fall short. I know what you’re thinking, “OK Granddad, get off your high horse and stop yelling at the kids to get off your lawn”. Well, I’m sorry (NOT SORRY) but it’s the truth as I see it. Lots of new tunes out there, but it's far and few between to find material that has that “it” factor. But I just found one, Gruesome's _Twisted Prayers_.

With a release date set for June 1st via Relapse Records, Gruesome’s new album _Twisted Prayers_ is plain and simply fucking brilliant! And guess what, boys and girls: brilliant has an I and T in it, which spells “it”.

It’s no secret that Gruesome is a band that pays straight homage to Death Metal pioneers Death (the band) and _Twisted Prayers_ from the first play sent me back to 1990 when I first bought my cassette copy of Death’s classic _Spiritual Healing_. Ever have one of those music moments when the hair stands up on your arm? Well, this was one for me. The sound, the feel, the familiarity of it all,was sensory overload for this “Granddad”.

Gruesome members Matt Harvey (guitar/vocals), Daniel Gonzalez (guitar), Robin Mazen (bass), and Gus Rios (drums) have already created a ton of killer material on their previous Gruesome releases: _Savage Land_, _Dimensions of Horror_ and _Fragments of Psyche_. But _Twisted Prayers_ is on a whole other level.

## A few things that really stand out on this album

Matt Harvey’s strong vocal style is made for this brand of Metal, and I think if Chuck Schuldiner was alive (RIP) he would fully agree. I personally don’t think anyone else could pull off the sound of this band, or its homage to Death like Matt does. There are moments on this album where I think I’m listening to Chuck; it really is that strong of a performance.

Matt and Daniel’s guitar work, holy shit, what a team. The first thing I immediately took notice of was the tone and the sound of their guitars; it had (once again) the “it” factor. The friendly playing back and forth off of each other, playing simultaneously, BIG sweeping guitar solos and then right back to blistering paces, these two guitarists created a beautiful, living piece of art that made me feel like a kid again. Well done, Dudes!

I find most of the time with Death Metal bands the bass gets blended in so much with the guitars everything has a tendency to sound the same and it’s hard to differentiate them. Not on this album, and not with Gruesome. Robin Mazen is a true renaissance woman – anybody in the Metal scene knows this – but she also plays one hell of a bass. Firm, thick, clean, groovy bass lines can be found throughout the entire record. I’ve said it a thousand times: I’m a sucker for killer grooves and Robin brings plenty of those to enjoy on this album. In the words of Lloyd Christmas, “I like it a lot”.

Last, but certainly not least, Mr. Gus Rios. The first sound you hear on _Twisted Prayers_ when starting the song “Inhumane” is those drums. Gus’s playing style on _Twisted Prayers_ (like all Gruesome albums) is straightforward, precise, smooth, effortless and to the point. And let’s not forget his sneaky double bass drumming; it is so damn good. I appreciate a drummer that doesn’t fuck around and throw in a bunch of useless garbage into a song where it’s not needed or doesn’t belong. That makes for a good record, and this one just happen to be a great one. Killer drumming, Brother!

Ever have a moment in life where you've heard, seen, or smelt something that whisks you away to when you were young, and it brought you comfort and or a feeling of joy? That is exactly what _Twisted Prayers_ did for me, comfort food so to speak in musical form.

Listen, I’m not here to blow smoke up anybody’s ass – I’m here to give you my opinion, and my opinion is this is going to be my album of the year. I realize it is only May, I understand there is a lot more music to come in 2018, but I highly doubt anything is going to come close to the happiness Gruesome’s _Twisted Prayers_ has brought me.

Hey you, fellow Metalhead, you owe it to yourself to be happy too. Pre-order this album, you will not regret it.
