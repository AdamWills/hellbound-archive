**Wykan** are making their music for all the right reasons. Not to show off body modifications; rather, they are all about brain modifications. They have dug deep into the primordial well-spring of the music that we all love. Inspired by the blues (working man’s music, just like heavy metal), doom metal and even a touch of psychedelic, Wykan are playing music from the Akashic Records. It always has been; hopefully it always will be.

Wykan’s music is tribal in its inspiration, and indeed musically it is definitely a case of journeying to the centre of the mind. Musical touchstones are Mastodon (up to _Crack the Skye_), Cream, Neurosis, High On Fire, and Sleep. Wykan are a special band, and I look forward to a full-length release from them.
