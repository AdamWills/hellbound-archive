## Raising funds + raising awareness on May 26th

Kitchener Metalfest returns on Saturday, May 26 for a celebration of metal and a 'frak off' to cancer. Beyond raising money, the organizers also aim to raise awareness about cancer prevention. Concert-goers can pick up some useful health information while enjoying some live metal – Vesperia, Atria, Maitreya, Lutharo, Raider, and AEpoch. And all proceeds from the show go to the Grand River Regional Cancer Centre.
