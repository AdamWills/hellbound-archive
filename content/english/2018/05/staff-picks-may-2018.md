Join us as we carry on a revived Hellbound tradition – our monthly staff picks/playlists. Every few weeks we ask our regular and longtime contributors to weigh in on what they’re listening to, watching, going to see… Expect a few quirks and idiosyncrasies now and then, but these are our standard staff pick categories:

**Listening to** – an album, ep or song from the library shelves (something that isn’t new) **New release** – a worthy album, ep or song released within the past couple of months **Live** – a recently enjoyed or highly anticipated live recording or gig **Non-metal** – an album, ep or song of choice from the non-metal world **Wild card** – a recommendation outside of or beyond the above picks

## HELLBOUND RECOMMENDS

### Bianca Bobescu

**Listening to:** Carcass - "Black Star" (_Swansong_, 1995)

**New release:** Lethvm - _This Fall Shall Cease_ — Great doom dose :))

**Live:** Jinjer live in Frankfurt, 18 May

### Steve Earles

**Listening to:** Deep Purple's _Stormbringer_ — Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale on vocals; we are not worthy!

**New release:** Shadygrove - _In The Heart of the Sacred Wood_ — really beautiful folk metal, with the emphasis on the folk aspect, just sublime.

**Non-metal:** Pink Floyd - _Animals_. This tends to be overlooked in favour of _Dark Side of the Moon_, unfairly so; while Gilmour's guitar playing is sublime, Waters hadn't yet totally succumbed to self-pity and over-analysis, and the songs are really strong.

**Wild card:** _The Exorcist_ \- The Version You Haven't Seen — like discovering parts of an old master were covered over and suddenly being able to see them. Moreover, with its acceptance of evil as a tangible physical force rather than as a metaphor or something that can be explained away and compartmentalized by science and psychology, _The Exorcist_ will always be a very important film.

### Gene Gaona

**Listening to:** _Danzig III_ - "How the Gods Kill", probably his best work on any album he has ever made.

**New release:** Exmortus - _The Sword of Steel_, releasing June 8th via Prosthetic Records. A bit of a “new” direction for this band, a ton more thrashing riffs along with the typical shredding. Such a good album.

**Live:** Obituary, DNA Lounge San Francisco 05/25. Not that I needed any confirmation of why Obituary has always been my favorite Death Metal band, but to see them live in a small club was un-fucking-believable. That sound, that sweet sweet low end tone. We got an interview with Trevor that should be up soon. It only made the night more special getting on that bus and backstage with them boys from Tampa. Living the dream!

**Non-metal:** Prince and the Revolution - _Purple Rain_ soundtrack

**Wild card:** Just saw Pink for the second time live in concert. She sings, dances, does aerial acrobatics; the woman is supremely talented and easy on the eyes, great performer.

### Danielle Griscti

**Listening to:** SIGH  - "Hail Horror Hell" [sigh.bandcamp.com](https://sigh.bandcamp.com)

**Live:** SATANIC GENOCIDE at the Bovine Sex Club, May 18th [satanicgenocide.bandcamp.com/releases](https://satanicgenocide.bandcamp.com/releases)

**Non-metal:** London Grammar, [www.youtube.com/user/LondonGrammar](https://www.youtube.com/user/LondonGrammar)

**Wild card:** Documentary flick _Accidental Parkland_ [accidentalparkland.tv](http://accidentalparkland.tv/) — trailer at [https://vimeo.com/130369056](https://vimeo.com/130369056)
