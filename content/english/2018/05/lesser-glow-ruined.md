This Boston post-sludge outfit allegedly tackles the perils of clickbait and social media on their debut, 25-minute EP. If Unsane and Neurosis came of age in the internet era, and subsequently joined forces, it might sound a little something like **Lesser Glow**.

The title track kicks things off, six minutes of swirling feedback, slow, crunchy riffs and gloomy, can actually sing, when he puts his mind to it. “Vacant Throne” is a little more straightforward, with that punishing 90’s noise-rock stomp, but it is not without its lighter, airier moments, as well. “Tel Meggido” is notably lighter from the get-go, but there is still a crunchy rhythm section underpinning its more melodic structure.

“Empty Eyes” veers back into noise-rock territory with a steady, downtuned hum, before “Under the Polar Shade” ends things on a slow, jagged, Neurosis-influenced note, with a couple of lighter, mellow sections mixed into its six-minute runtime. (There is also a mellow, 98-second interlude in between the two tunes.) I might not be any more attuned to the evils of modern technology after listening, but this is a pretty good first impression for Lesser Glow.
