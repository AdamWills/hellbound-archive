_Downfall_ is an impressive effort for a young band. It shows a great chemistry between band members Nick Saunter on guitar, Jon Kal on bass, Josh Masterson on vocal and Dylan Waybrant on drums. Their musicianship is first class, as you’d expect from a band that has been playing together for years. Nothing beats hard work! Overall, on the strength of _Downfall_ – which also features Lindsay Schoolcraft (Cradle of Filth) on vocals and keyboard on the track "New Skin" – the next release from **Fallen Legion** should be something special.
