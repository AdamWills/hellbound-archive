Like Mogwai meeting Black Sabbath, this is music that mines dark inner depths. The music is given a chance to breathe, to surge and fall, like a painting composed of monochrome darkness.

I felt ‘the Nihilist Engine’ the album refers to could be the modern world we live in, a world that crushes hope if we let it.

I won’t mention too many comparisons to other bands, but I was reminded of Neurosis, Shrinebuilder, Bauhaus and Joy Division, even The Fall. Nevertheless, **Grave Lines** are very much their own beast.

Moving, original, powerful, and courageous, possibly the heaviest album – emotionally, musically, those are riffs so powerful it reaches you at a primal level.
