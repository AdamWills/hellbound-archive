Australia has a great track record for producing classic rock acts like Rose Tattoo and AC/DC, so it is no surprise that **Greystone Canyon**, hailing from Australia, have those bands in their musical DNA.

The very name Greystone Canyon sums up images of cowboys on a vast empty landscape. It’s a very cool name for a band.

_While The Wheels Still Turn_ was mixed by the legendary Glen Robinson who has worked with such mighty bands as Voivod and Annihilator, so it’s superb sound comes as no surprise.

Inspired by Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne and King Diamond, this is a timeless album that would appeal to fans of the above bands.
