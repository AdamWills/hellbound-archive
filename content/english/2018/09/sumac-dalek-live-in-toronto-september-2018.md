## SUMAC, Dälek & Infernal Coil. Toronto @ The Garrison, 4 September 2018

Sumac took to the stage this past Tuesday evening in Toronto at The Garrison and those in attendance were treated to a truly spectacular performance from the trio.

Currently on a short tour leading up to the release of their new album _Love in Shadow_, Sumac has brought **Dälek** along with them, providing a fresh experimental hip-hop sound, as well as **Infernal Coil**, who opened the show loud and fast.

Minutes before **Sumac** played the audience was silent and eager. They walked out, picked up their instruments and from the first note they hypnotized everyone in the room with devastatingly heavy bass tones and calm yet distressing guitar riffs. Drummer Nick Yacyshyn complements those moments perfectly behind the kit and the chemistry between him, Aaron Turner (guitar, vocals), and Brian Cook (bass) is undeniably impressive to watch. There were moments during their set where you just had to shake your head in disbelief at what you were seeing and hearing. Their set takes you on an epic journey from start to finish and their sound is unique from any heavy band you’ve ever heard before. And believe me when I say they are heavy.

If you’re a fan or you’ve been curious about them in the past I would highly suggest checking out the remaining dates to see if they will be in your area. Musically, Sumac is at the top of their game and you will not be disappointed.
