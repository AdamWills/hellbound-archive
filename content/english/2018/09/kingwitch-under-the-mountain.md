This is an extremely impressive debut album; anyone whose taste runs from Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath through to Mastodon will find much to enjoy here. Kingwitch’s musicianship is extremely strong as is their songwriting; these are truly great songs, catchy and complex at the same time, with truly engaging lyrics. At times I was reminded of the magic of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and _Nightfall_\-era Candlemass. But Kingwitch are truly their own creation, just waiting for you to discover them. Kingwitch’s secret weapon is the bewitching Laura Donnelly, who has a truly memorable voice.

One to watch out for in the future.
