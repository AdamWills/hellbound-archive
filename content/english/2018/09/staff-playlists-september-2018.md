Join us as we once again continue with this revived Hellbound tradition – our monthly staff picks/playlists. This time around we've got the usual categories, plus we're taking a look back to highlight some albums from 2018 you may have missed.

## HELLBOUND RECOMMENDS

### Steve Earles

**Listening to:** Hawkwind's _Road To Utopia_. Even after all these years Hawkwind are still capable of producing music that is strange and beautiful.

**New Release:** Iron Void's _Excalibur_. Iron Void are the kind of band that truly deserve a wider audience, producing album after album of quality metal for the sheer love of it. Here, their doom meets NWOBHM sound tackles the Arthurian legends, beautifully packaged too.

**Overlooked 2018 release:** Carpenter Brut's _Leather Teeth_. Great soundtrack to film that doesn't exist, but really needs to!

**Non metal:** _Best of Chuck Berry_. Brilliant songs, putting today's spotified garbage to shame.

**Wild Card:** _The Plague_. A six-part Spanish-language series set in Seville during an outbreak of the Black Death in the 17th century. Beautifully made, the series is very relevant for our times. One character says: The real plague is ignorance. That's what will do away with humanity.' As true now, in our world of fake news, as it was then.

### Gene A. Gaona

**Listening to:** Deep Purple, _Machine Head_ album. Getting ready for tomorrow night's show with Judas Priest.

**New release:** Satan, _Cruel Magic_ released September 7th on Metal Blade Records. Fun 70's Heavy Metal throw back sounding record.

**Live:** Traveling around Texas seeing Philip H. Anselmo and the Illegals 3 nights in a row, extreme, tight and powerful band. Also pretty cool to see Phil sing some Pantera tunes as well.

**Overlooked release:** Genocide Pact, _Order of Torment_ album released February 2nd via Relapse Records, dark, groovy fun Death Metal.

**Non-metal:** Hank III, _Straight to Hell_ album

**Wild card:** A band I saw while in Texas called Flesh Hoarder, brutal Death Metal and they released an album this year called _Homicidal Necrophile_. Pretty sure the name speaks for itself to how heavy the band is..

### Matt Hinch

**Listening to:** [Nine Inch Nails - _With Teeth_](https://open.spotify.com/album/56Us3Q6UIM4jKJZlWhqddL?si=aLipO7j2T2CnpFtPjzh9PQ). My NIN knowledge is limited but I like this album better than _The Downward Spiral_.

**New release:** Brant Bjork - _Mankind Woman_. Brant Bjork is the master of groove and his latest has soul, gets funky, and is one of my absolute favourites of the year.

**Live:** I saw Cancer Bats in Kingston on Sept 20 at the Mansion. As always they completely ruled. Surprisingly enough my neck pain only lasted a couple days!

**Overlooked 2018 release:** Sunnata - _Outlands_. Hypnotic and heavy stoner/sludge/doom from Poland. Transcendent!

\[bandcamp width=100% height=120 album=495796751 size=large bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 tracklist=false artwork=small\]

**Non-metal:** [Briena Pearl - _Reckless Duality_](https://open.spotify.com/album/083enNwprP2KISFmUpguJm?si=JoxF1nrMRbKzxA2c0XFjFg). Pearl sang for Tim Sult's (Clutch, Bakerton Group) short-lived side project, Deep Swell. Lots of acoustics, folk vibes, some horns here and there, some more rockin' tunes, but Pearl just does what she wants here and of course, her vocal personality shines brightly.

**Wild card:** The 2018 edition of the **Metal Alliance Tour** features Goatwhore, the Casualties, Great American Ghost, Black Tusk and on select dates, Gozu (others Morthereon). There are three Canadian dates (all with Gozu). Kingston, ON, Montreal, and Quebec City. NO TORONTO DATE. So feel free to come on down to Kingston and hang out with ME!

### Daniel Smith

**Listening to:** Gevurah - _Hallelujah!_ (2016, Profound Lore Records). A magnum opus from French-Canadian black metal philosophers. This is a crushing album that combines horrifying instrumentation and multi-faceted lyrics in efforts to convey their esoteric message.

**New release:** Sumac - _Love in Shadow_ (2018, Thrill Jockey Records). A crushing landmark release from the experimental atmospheric sludge metal trio from Vancouver, BC.

**Live:** [Behemoth, Wolves in the Throne Room and At the Gates (November 6, The Danforth Music Hall. Toronto)](https://www.facebook.com/events/265411584233674/) I've seen Wolves in the Throne room once and the fact they are playing with these other two is very exciting.

**Overlooked 2018 release:** Spectral Lore/Jute Gyte - Helian (SPLIT) (2018, I, Voidhanger Records). I've been listening to Spectral Lore for a while and this is probably the most talented one-man project out there. His side of the split is no exception. I also recommend checking out his masterpiece of an EP, Gnosis from 2015.

**Non-metal:** Sun Kil Moon - _Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood_ (2017, Caldo Verde Records). An amazing 2 hour and 10 minute long masterpiece of folk and spoken word by Mark Kozelek. Don't miss out on this one.

**Wild card:** _The Sacrifice (Offret)_ (1986) by Andrei Tarkovsky at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in 4K on November 3rd. I've been waiting for years to see this amazing film in all its glory and now I can finally get a chance to see it in beautiful 4K for the first time.
