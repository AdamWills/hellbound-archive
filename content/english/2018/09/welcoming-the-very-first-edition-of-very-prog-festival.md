![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dy8mxogvn/image/upload/v1537722927/very-prog-festival-poster_rhfi3x.jpg) Exciting news for prog metal fans! There's a brand new festival emerging dedicated to the genre: [**Very Prog Festival**](http://www.veryprogfestival.com). Its very first edition will be taking place on October 12-13, 2018 at Le Metronum in Toulouse, France.

Le Metronum, a 600 person capacity venue, welcomes bands round the year and is no newbie to hosting festivals. This time enthusiasts of the progressive genre will occupy its two rooms.

For a new festival VPF has got a brilliant line up consisting of French and international acts, up and coming bands as well as established artists.

The festival will be opened by **Amon Stehis** – a French project built on the concept of the Seventh dynasty of Egyptian Pharaohs and described by themselves as a "powerful, varied, sometimes bewitching musical and visual experience".

We will also be able to see **Taotopia** – a local djent oriented band who released their debut album _Nightfall_ in March 2018, Italian progressive metal five piece **Soul Secret,** progressive-melodic metal band **DGM,** a group that has put the small country of Andorra on the map of metal scene – **Persefone** and French **Spheric Universe Experience** who are no newbies to internationally acclaimed festivals. Currently working on a new album, they will be performing at Very Prog Festival together with bass player Julien Negro.

Friday’s headliners will be Australian prog metallers **Caligula's Horse.** On Saturday same duty will go to American prog metal supergroup **Sons Of Apollo**.
