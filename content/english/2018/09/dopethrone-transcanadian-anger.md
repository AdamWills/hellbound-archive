They may be named after an Electric Wizard record, but I’ve always found **Dopethrone** to be more like Canada’s answer to Bongzilla, with heavy, hazy riffs and drug references abound on their fifth full-length album.

_Transcanadian Anger_ kicks off with a fuzzy rumble on “Planet Meth,” a downtuned, downtrodden stomp with shades of EHG. The heavy grooves will get your head nodding on this one—bathtub crank not included. “Wrong Sabbath” begins with a Sleepy bass line, a mellower intro giving way to some pure Pike worship. “Killdozer” is a lumbering, rumbling piece of sludge that definitely brings Bongzilla to mind, while “Scuzzgasm” has some of the best NOLA-style sludge riffs you’ll hear this year.

The second half is loaded with drug numbers like the Weedeater sneer of “Tweak Jabber,” the lugubrious “Snort Dagger” and “Kingbilly Kush,” a bastardized sludge-metal version of ZZ Top’s “Tush,” which, in this case, is about weed. “Miserabilist” ends things on another Eyehategod/Bongzilla note, a gritty sludge number with some vicious guest vocals. This record might not stand out in the Dopethrone discography, but it’s sludge done just the way I like it.
