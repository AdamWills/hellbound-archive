There must be something in the water, or more correctly, _ice_, in Finland. It seems to work wonders for the creativity of Finnish bands – just look, for example, at the extraordinary output of Circle.

_Bareback_ is **Throat**’s second album and sees them explore new musical vistas. To their 90s-inspired noise rock they have added new influences such as indie music and post-hardcore. Throat are a band that clearly value creativity above easy listening, and if that’s your bag, then Throat are a band you’ll really get something out of.
