**Diemonds** follow up 2015’s Juno-nominated, High Times Magazine Doobie Award-winning _Never Wanna Die_ with _Diemonds_, a powerful self-titled release. The record is masterfully produced, engineered, and mixed by the returning Eric Ratz, who has previously worked with Canadian heavyweights Monster Truck and The Cancer Bats. His efforts give this album a perfectly balanced sound that is still rough around the edges.

From beginning to end, this album never fails to deliver the goods. With powerful riffs, the album boasts a powerfully rebellious attitude, brimming with heart and conviction. Fueled by a groove oriented rhythm section, _Diemonds_ carries a seamless pace of energy and melody.

With tracks like "How Long, Burn It Down" and "Warrior", Diemonds are well on their way to another Juno nomination. The band has refined its sound down to its most honest, and purest form, while maintaining a level of energy that belongs in stadiums and festivals around the world. The band wears its heart and influences on its collective sleeve with the songs "How Long", "Made it Through" and "I See Red".

Overall, the album's anthemic nature and take no prisoners attitude is sure to propel Diemonds to the next level of rock stardom.
