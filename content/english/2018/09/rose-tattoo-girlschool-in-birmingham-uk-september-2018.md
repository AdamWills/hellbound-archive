## Rose Tattoo with special guests Girlschool

### September 11th 2018 O2 Academy Birmingham, UK

2018 is a busy year for Australian Rock N' Roll Outlaws Rose Tattoo: the reissue of their 2007 album _Blood Brothers_ followed by an East Coast of Australia tour, before heading to Europe to take on a long list of dates, including leading festivals like Sweden Rock, Rockavaria and Hellfest.

Tonight was Birmingham. Even though it wasn't a sell out, the O2 Academy seemed pretty packed with AC/DC, Motorhead and, of course, Rose Tattoo T-shirts, and mainly the generation that would remember the beginnings of both of today's bands. The hour between opening the door and the first act taking the stage was quite enough for the mainly male-oriented crowd to get their drinks sorted.

Support this evening came from British all-female heavy metal band **Girlschool**. They were one act certainly enjoying themselves and very fun to watch. There are more notorious girl outfits, but the fact I like about this band: they are not about looks. They do dress for the show, but it is all about straightforward balls to the wall rock 'n' roll. And they did not disappoint there! Girlschool's 45-minute long set contained some of band's latest material as well as classics like 'Kick It Down', 'Yea Right', and 'Hit And Run'.

**Rose Tattoo** got a big cheer as soon they got on the stage and went straight in with 'One Of The Boys' from their 1978 self titled debut album. Tatts over an hour long set had plenty of classics thrown in. As expected from a band influential to many (even Guns N Roses released their version of the track 'Nice Boys'), it was a great evening. There was interaction with the crowd, joking, instrumental interludes perfect for air guitaring and plenty of moments were the whole crowd was nodding to the rhythm and singing along.

Adrenalin fuelled good Aussie blues based rock 'n' roll at its best.
