After four albums and over 11 years of countless shows and tours across Canada and the world, **Cauldron**’s highly anticipated release [_New Gods_](http://smarturl.it/CauldronNewGods), which is available now from [The End Records](http://www.theendrecords.com/), further cements their legacy. Masterfully produced by Chris Stringer at Toronto's [Union Sound Company](https://unionsoundcompany.com/), _New Gods_ perfectly captures everything you would expect from Cauldron. Punctuated by track after track of masterful melodies, raw power and strong songwriting stands strong against Cauldron's already amazing back catalog.
