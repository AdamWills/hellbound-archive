## Attila with Suicide Silence, Volumes, Spite, and Cross Your Fingers

### Fonda Theatre, Los Angeles, CA - 24 August 2018

Just as you thought summer was over **Attila** came through and brought the party to us once again with a tour called **Rage Fest**. This was the most insane line up of bands and talent I have ever seen, consisting of the metal bands Suicide Silence, Volumes, Rings of Saturn, Spite, and Cross Your Fingers. They all brought the energy and rage to the crowd. Mosh pits broke out everywhere, leaving all the fans to collide in a wall of death. This show was definitely one to remember.
