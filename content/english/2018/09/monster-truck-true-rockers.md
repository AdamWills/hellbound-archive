Fresh off the road from opening for the legendary Deep Purple in Europe, **[Monster Truck](http://www.ilovemonstertruck.com)** hit the studio to record the follow up to 2016’s [_Sittin’ Heavy_](https://monstertruck.store-08.com/featured/mntr050011-monster-truck-sittin-heavy-12-vinyl-picture-disc/)_._ [_True_ Rockers](https://www.dinealonestore.com/collections/pre-orders/products/monster-truck-true-rocker-lp), available on 9/14/2018 from [Dine Alone Records](http://dinealonerecords.com/) is holds its own against the band's brilliant back catalog. Monster Truck is a band that has clearly carved their own path from winning a Juno Award in 2013, to proudly representing Canadian Rock in front of thousands across the world with some of the biggest names in rock and metal. This album delivers everything you would expect from Monster Truck and more.

Anthemic tracks like "[True Rocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YamD_7ILXHk)," which features the legendary Dee Snider, and "Thundertruck" perfectly contrast to Monster Truck's more soulful, bluesy side.The album does take a bit of a departure into the unexpected with tracks like "Evolution" and "Young City Hearts_."_ both are great songs, but feel slightly out of place with the rest of the album. This does not stop the album from being filled with high octane rock and roll that never disappoints. This album should be considered a serious contender for another Juno award for the band.
