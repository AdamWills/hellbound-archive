![](https://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Toxik-live-Toronto-2018.jpg)Back in March, New York's **TOXIK** were scheduled to play live dates in Quebec City, Montreal and Toronto. These shows didn't happen – Toxik got stopped at the US/Canada border. But take-two is happening this month, with the band's rescheduled date in Toronto set for [**Saturday, August 25 at Coalition T.O**](https://www.facebook.com/events/898830173638308/)., presented by [Heavy & Humble Productions](https://www.facebook.com/HeavyandHumble/).

When Toxik's mini Canadian tour was first announced, fans were promised a rare performance of material from the band's two classic albums – _World Circus_ (1987) and _Think This_ (1989) – on top of tracks from new EP _Breaking Class_ (2017). This plan is still in place for Saturday's make-up date, which may be the last time ever that Toxik perform with their original singer, **Mike Sanders**.

Tickets are $20 in advance from [Stained Class Records](https://www.facebook.com/stainedclassrecords/), [Coalition T.O.](https://www.facebook.com/coalitiontoronto/) and [Brown Paper Tickets](https://toxiktoronto.brownpapertickets.com/), or $25 at the door.

Opening for Toxik in Toronto will be Droid, Cellphone, and AxMinister.
