With the length of time that has elapsed since **Sleep** released _Jerusalem_, it would be logical to think that with the passage of time, Sleep’s ability to forge earth-crushing riffs might have diminished. But no, _The Sciences_ can stand beside _Holy Mountain_ and the aforementioned _Jerusalem_. It is, in the best possible way, exactly what you’d expect. Huge riffs from Matt Pike, Al Cisneros’s Sabbath-esque bass lines (indeed the album features a track wittily entitled "Giza Butler" – Ancients Aliens meets Black Sabbath, which sums up a lot of Sleep’s inspirations). "Sonic Titan" and "Antarcticans Thawed" are classic Sleep tracks, with a real cosmic (out-there, mannn!) vision. Sleep’s music is true, not in an elitist cliquey way but sincere, and in many respects genre-breaking, Sleep have metal’s good points but none of its negative ones.
