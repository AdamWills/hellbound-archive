With both of these Relapse sludgy doomsters known for their droning, drawn-out numbers, I’m surprised this split between Primitive Man and Unearthly Trance is under 45 minutes. Each band gets three songs, with the opening track “Merging” serving as a mysterious one-minute collaboration between them both.

Actually scratch that, **Primitive Man**’s A Side only has two other numbers, and they’re both pretty epic. The 10-and-a-half-minute “Naked” takes a little while to get going, as the first few minutes are mostly just feedback. The first inkling of a riff doesn’t come in until just after three minutes, and it’s a little lighter than what we’d expect from PM—more along the lines of Neurosis, but still backed by a voluminous swirl of feedback. They do get heavier and sludgier before the vocals come in around 5:30, but they definitely aren’t going anywhere fast.

“Love Under Will” is only slightly shorter at a shade over nine min. They definitely couldda shaved some time off the top—the first couple minutes are just some sound effects that come off as background noises from _The Blair Witch_. Actually, it’s not just the first couple minutes. It’s all nine of them… although they do add an underwater, unintelligible, spoken-word vocal toward the end?

**Unearthly Trance** opens Side B with “Mechanism Error,” a seven-minute number that wastes little time in getting down to sludgy business—the first vomitous vocals arrive around the 45-second mark. This song is also slow and sparse, but at least it offers a little more to nod yer head to. “Triumph” is even more pointed, opening with a mighty roar and a chugging riff. This one even borders on slow-mo death metal…perhaps we’ll call it death doom?

“Reverse the Day” starts off with a similarly gloomy outlook, with a drum-driven verse leading to a percussion-heavy chorus. The vocal bile is strong with this one, too. “418” ends things on a rather anti-climatic note, with harsh vocals and shimmering feedback. Hate to say it, but this mostly sounds like a collection of throwaway tracks.
