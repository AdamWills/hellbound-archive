Join us as we continue with this revived Hellbound tradition – our monthly staff picks/playlists. Every few weeks we ask our contributors to weigh in on what they’re listening to, watching, going to see… Expect a few quirks and idiosyncrasies now and then, but these are our standard staff pick categories:

**Listening to** – an album, ep or song from the library shelves (something that isn’t new) **New release** – a worthy album, ep or song released within the past couple of months **Live** – a recently enjoyed or highly anticipated live recording or gig **Non-metal** – an album, ep or song of choice from the non-metal world **Wild card** – a recommendation outside of or beyond the above.

## HELLBOUND RECOMMENDS

### Bill Adams

**Listening to:** Bass Drum of Death - _Just Business_ Rough, rugged, rocky and raw. As I listen right now, it feels like Bass Drum of Death and _Just Business_ might be the new breath that rock has so desperately needed for about a decade.

**New release:** _Deadpool 2_ score That this film score album managed to draw an explicit content warning was what got me interested in the Deadpool 2 score at first, but it didn't take long for the compositions to really grab and hold my interest. The easiest way to phrase it is that this album successfully rethinks the normally pretty staid form of score releases and ends up presenting an artifact that can rightly be called post-modern in the way each track keeps to the basic paradigm of score presentations but tweeks it just enough to make it seem fresh and new in spirit, disposition and form.

**Non-metal:** Arthur Buck - s/t Full honesty and complete disclosure, I've been a really big fan of R.E.M. for a really long time and approached this new album with no small amount of trepidation. I didn't want to risk sullying my memory of Peter Buck. Turns out that I needn't have worried though; by crossing Buck's instantly recognizable guitar tone (which, let's be honest, helped inspire almost an entire generation of indie songwriters) with Joe Arthur's bluesy,backwoods soul, this album finds a great sound that can satiated R.E.M. fans without coming off as derivative in the slightest.

**Wild card:** Binge-watching old episodes of HBO's _Tales From The Crypt_. Why? Because it's like codeine; it gets you wired and makes you smile.

### Bianca Bobescu

**Listening to:** PARADISE LOST - "No Hope In Sight" (_The Plague Within_, 2015)

**New release:** Tremonti - _A dying machine_ (8 June 2018, Napalm Records)

**Live:** The One Armed Man live at Lixing les Rouhling, France

**Non-metal:** The One Armed Man - "Black Hills" (Flying Cow Prod, 2014) Genre: Rock'n Roll / Folk / Bluegrass.

### Steve Earles

**Listening to:** _NWOBHM_ Killer 2CD compilation of, as you'd expect from the title, New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands. Not having heard them the first time around I was blown away, not just by the quality of the music but its joyous spirit.

**Live:** Dolan's Limerick, with the mighty Conan, metal in its rawest and primeval form, no frill, just sheer heaviness.

**Non-metal:** John Carpenter's _Christine_ soundtrack on Death Waltz. I actually like that film (King's books are usually too long to incorporate every sacred utterance into a film, so Carpenter did a pretty good job). The music itself is a fabulous slice of Carpenter at his best, and I look forward to his soundtrack to the new _Halloween_ this... Halloween.

**Wild card:** _Calvary_ starring Brendan Gleeson, a harsh and merciless look at everyday life, at people's true hidden nature, their shadow sides. Far more disturbing than any so-called horror film.

### Gene Gaona

**Listening to:** Gruesome - _Savage Land_ (Relapse Records, 2015)

**New release:** Jungle Rot - _Jungle Rot_ (2018)

### Gruesome Greg

**Listening to:** Monster Magnet - _Superjudge_

**New release:** La Chinga - _Beyond the Sky_

**Live:** Black Tusk/Whores/WhiteNails @ Lee's Palace

**Non-metal:** Cody Jinks - _I'm Not the Devil_

**Wild card:** Going to see if I can digest a $100 gold burger at the CNE. Stay tuned...

### Keith Lloyd

**Listening to:** Thünderkok - _Kokaine_ I got the chance to be introduced to this band in a live setting a few weeks ago, and they played one of the most over the top, high energy sets I have seen in quite some time. Somehow they were able to capture this energy on record! I’m looking forward to seeing what they have in store for their next release!

**New release:** Powerwolf - _The Sacrament of Sin_ _The Sacrament of Sin_ is one of those albums where everything comes together perfectly for a band. The album is brilliantly produced and mixed, the songs are strong, with just enough of a hook to keep you listening.

**Live:** Devin Townsend Project - _Ocean Machine Live At The Ancient Roman Theatre Plovdiv_ I believe that Devin Townsend is one of the most under appreciated Canadian musicians around. Devin Townsend Project - _Ocean Machine Live At The Ancient Roman Theatre Plovdiv_ is one of the most mind bending, fascinating, and generally epic live performances I have seen in some time!

**Non-metal:** The Darkness - _Pinewood Smile_ _Pinewood Smile_ is a true return to form for The Darkness. There is not a single track off this album that I don’t enjoy listening to. I’m glad after all these years, they can still remind me of Spinal Tap.

**Wild card:** [Ketography](https://www.facebook.com/ketography1990/) It’s been an exciting year for me so far. I was front row for Judas Priest/Saxon, but most of all, I got my photography business up and running, thanks to help from family, friends and the fine folks here at Hellbound!
