![](https://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Aftershock-2018.jpg)With summer in full swing, as everyone heads (and has headed) out and about to take in their favorite music festival, let’s not forget one experience that is a must for any music lover: [**Monster Energy’s Aftershock Festival**](https://aftershockfestival.com/).

Aftershock takes place October 13th and 14th in beautiful Discovery Park, located in Sacramento, California. For the 7th year straight the organizers of this fantastic festival have put together another versatile package of music spanning multiple genres which makes it California’s premier music festival. Each year the diversity bar seems to be raised a little higher, and that’s a good thing. Many multiple-day festivals seem to cater to one specific genre, with the occasional “I wonder why they booked these guys” thrown in. Aftershock is, and has been, progressive in the artists they book for some time now and kudos to them for doing so. With 2018’s lineup consisting of artists like **System Of A Down**, **Deftones**, **Alice In Chains**, **Incubus**, **Godsmack**, **Shinedown**, **Slash**, **Action Bronson**, **Emmure**, **GWAR**, and **Everlast_,_** just to name a few, you know there’s going to be a good time had by all.

Besides Aftershock Festival having one of the strongest and most diverse lineups, they also have an outstanding food selection, as well as local vendors selling their arts and crafts. It definitely adds to the ambience of the festival in Discovery Park amongst the tree lines and large grass areas. Talk about a relaxing day of fun, food and killer music, Aftershock is all those things and more.

So if you want to step out of your comfort zone a little and be exposed to new music, or an artist you may have never heard of, Aftershock Festival in Sacramento is where you need to be. Who knows, a **Sevendust** fan could walk away becoming a **Dorothy** fan, or a **Hyro The Hero** fan could get home and realize he or she really liked the set **Underoath** did. You never know.
