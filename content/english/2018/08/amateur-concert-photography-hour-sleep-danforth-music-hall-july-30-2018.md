Man, this was the fifth time I've seen Sleep since 2010...and the first time they played any new material. ("The Clarity" doesn't count!) But hey, [their new record is pretty sweet](https://hellbound.ca/2018/04/sleep-the-sciences/), so I'm definitely not complaining. And since they actually played two full sets, with a 15-minute intermission in between, I still heard all the songs I really wanted to hear.

And, with the exception of the plodding, OM-sounding "[Leagues Beneath](https://soundcloud.com/adultswimsingles/sleep)"--which didn't actually make the cut on their new album--I'd say the new tunes help up pretty well in the live setting.
