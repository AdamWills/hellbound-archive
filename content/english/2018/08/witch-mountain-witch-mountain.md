The three previous albums from **Witch Mountain** – _Cauldron of the Wild_, _South of Salem_, _Mobile of Angels_ – are truly superb. This is the first Witch Mountain album with Kayla Dixon on vocals. She has an incredible voice, powerful, heartfelt. The songs are excellent. This is timeless music, made for all the right reasons. Billy Anderson comes through with superb production, just right. _Witch Mountain_ is for fans of Sleep, Psychedelic Witchcraft, Lucifer, Goatsnake, Saint Vitus, Trouble, The Obsessed, Shrinebuilder, Neurosis… in other words, heavy music from the heart and mind!

This time round, I truly hope Witch Mountain achieve the audience they have always deserved.
