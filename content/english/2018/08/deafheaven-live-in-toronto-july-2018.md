## Deafheaven with Uniform – Friday, 27 July 2018 @ The Opera House, Toronto, ON

I cannot believe I just saw Deafheaven. The show felt like it took forever to approach and was over with too quickly. That's how all life's joys go though. Drab Majesty were absent as they had some issues getting across the border and had to cancel the Toronto and Montreal dates. Uniform and Deafheaven were still enough to make me happy thankfully, it just meant an extremely short show. It was probably less than two hours long.

**Uniform**, similar to the Windsor powerviolence group, Minors, totally shook me. To me, powerviolence is a genre of hardcore metal that never fails to terrify. They're frontman was very expressive and was very into it.

**Deafheaven** was absolutely unreal. The tour was to support the release of their new record, _Ordinary Corrupt Human Love_, a difficult album to come after _New Bermuda_ and _Sunbather_. It's a very subversive and divisive record but they performed it to the best of their ability. The highlight of the show was definitely their playing of the songs "Honeycomb" and "Brought to the Water."
