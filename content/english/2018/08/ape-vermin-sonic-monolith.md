_Sonic Monolith_ is an impressive debut for a band that only formed last year. It’s a band that have a built in audience with their Sabbath-meets-Conan sludge metal.

The album also has a concept, that of higher beings attempting to repopulate the galaxy with a new species of ape… as you do! Well, it could only be an improvement on us.

The album doesn’t overstay its welcome and thus has more of an effect on the listener. It’s an album that’s well packaged with excellent artwork, and one that bodes well for the future.
