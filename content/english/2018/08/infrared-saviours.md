"Not dead which eternal lies / But with stranger aeons even death may die." ... The words of H.P. Lovecraft referring to his Cthulu Mythos, but they could so easily apply to thrash metal, with new bands inspired by the original artists, and indeed, the original artists themselves returning. Such a band is **Infrared**, who are not just inspired by ‘80s thrash metal. They _are_ ‘80s thrash metal!

_Saviours_ follows their well-received _No Peace_ EP, which featured tracks originally written in the 80s. Pleasingly, _Saviours_ features all-new material. It is an excellent album, killer thrash with NWOBHM melodic sensibilities, proper singing, hooks, the full nine yards!

This is an album all self-respecting thrashers should have in their collection.
