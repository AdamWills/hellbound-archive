A band needs a good name, and **Burning Witches** is an excellent one. This group of five lady metallers truly are on fire! Musically, this is old school metal, à la Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and especially the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Which is to say, your actual songs! There are enough contemporary influences that Burning Witches can stand toe-to-toe with the likes of Arch Enemy and Unleash The Archers. A fine cover of Judas Priest’s ‘Jawbreaker’ nails their colours to the mast as regards influences, but it says a lot for their own material that Burning Witches’ own songs stand seamlessly beside it.

Great songs, great musicianship… great band!
