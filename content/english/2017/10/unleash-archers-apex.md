**Unleash The Archers** play excellent traditional metal, which I very much mean as a compliment. There are occasional diversions into harsher vocal realms, but this is unnecessary when you’ve got a vocalist as good as Brittney Slayes. Like Kobra Paige, she gives her band a strong identity and has a most metal name as an added bonus. Overall, a strong album from a band that deserves a wide audience. Stand out tracks include ‘Earth and Ashes’ and ‘Call Me Immortal’ but all the tracks work well together, forming an excellent piece of work.
