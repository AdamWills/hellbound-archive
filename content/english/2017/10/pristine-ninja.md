As Nuclear Blast’s roster expands like some musical big bang, so does it get more and more diverse. Case in point is **Pristine**. Their music is hard to pigeonhole, which is as it should be, because it’s simply very good – a mixture of psychedelic rock, blues, hard rock and funk. Strong vocals from Heidi Solheim give this Norwegian band a strong sound of their own and I can see this album, like Blues Pills’ work, appealing to a broad swath of music lovers.
