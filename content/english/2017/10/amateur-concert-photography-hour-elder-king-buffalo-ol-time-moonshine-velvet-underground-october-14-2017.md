Who knew that Elder had a posse? Their first Toronto appearance pretty much packed the Velvet Underground for a late-night gig on Saturday. Although the doors didn't open till 11, the show ran pretty much on time--even with two opening bands, we were outta there by 2 am. And hey, after playing nothing but reggae between bands at the [Weedeater gig back in June](https://hellbound.ca/2017/06/amateur-concert-photography-hour-weedeaterblack-wizardserial-hawk-velvet-underground-june-22-2017/), I'm pleased to report that the venue played nothing but Weedeater between bands this evening. I guess they musta bummed a CD offa Dixie Dave or something.

Of course, the late start meant super-short sets for the opening acts. Local riff peddlers [Ol' Time Moonshine](https://oltimemoonshine.bandcamp.com/) took the stage before most people in line even made it into the venue, and played a brisk 20-minute set. Even without their regular drummer, the band sounded pretty tight.

[King Buffalo](http://kingbuffalo.com/) seemed much more at home here than they did at the Weedeater gig. The youngsters from Rochester play a mellower brand of heavy psych more akin to Dead Meadow, setting the table for Elder quite nicely with a solid half-hour set.

I had the good fortune of seeing [Elder slay at Psycho Las Vegas](https://hellbound.ca/2016/09/psycho-las-vegas-day-one-recap/) last year, so I knew we were in for a good one. These guys really kick out the jams, man! Normally a trio, they've enlisted a guest guitarist on their latest album, and thus performed this evening as a four-piece. The additional axeslinger really gives these songs a big boost!
