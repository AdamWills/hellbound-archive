_The Limehouse Golem_ is the best new film I’ve seen thus far this year. I will give no spoilers, save to say that this is a superb horror-thriller set in Victorian London, with Police Inspector John Kildare (Bill Nighy) trying to catch the titular Limehouse Golem (a Ripper-esque killer… or is it?).

No, rather than revealing any plot details I shall instead list what makes _The Limehouse Golem_ special and a ‘must see’ on the Big Screen.

The source material: ‘_The Limehouse Golem_’ is based on an excellent novel called ‘_Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem_’ by Peter Ackroyd, which I’ve read. This is an excellent book to adapt into a motion picture. Ackroyd is one of the great British writers, a modern day Charles Dickens. These days he concentrates mainly on history books (I am reading his ‘_London Under_’, which is superb). When he writes fiction he does so with the research of a historian, and when he writes history, he does so with a novelist’s verve.

The script: a truly outstanding one by Jane Goldman, who did a grand job on Hammer’s adaptation of ‘_The Woman in Black_’ by Susan Hill. She deserves a BAFTA for her efforts here. She has also added a feminist element to the story, and makes you think deeply and ask yourself questions, hard ones. Such as, if we help people, are a person’s motives _ever_ truly unselfish, or are we merely trying to satisfy our own wants? The theme of true motivations is writ large in Goldman’s script.

The performances: all first class, especially Bill Nighy, Olivia Cooke, Maria Valverde, Douglas Booth and Eddie Marsan.

The direction of Juan Carlos Medina, like a cross between Guillermo Del Toro and Terence Fisher.

The look. It is very Hammer Horror, and I mean that as the greatest compliment; it brought to mind such films as ‘_Hands of the Ripper_’.

Finally as a whole, it’s a very organic entity – a piece of art, everything just right. Magical, shocking, funny, thought-provoking; it covers a dark rainbow of human emotions and it will stay with you long after you’ve left the cinema.
