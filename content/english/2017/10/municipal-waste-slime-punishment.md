This is music without scepticism; it is created with innocence as all good art should be. **Municipal Waste** are a band truly born out of time, weaned on a diet of beer, 80s music and films – they create their own version of what we now can see was creatively a great time. Lots of people feel the same way. Just look at the popularity of ‘_Stranger Things_’ or ‘_Ash vs Evil Dead’_. Part of this is the time of fast-paced change and global uncertainty. Fear is big business in 2017.

Municipal Waste are the antidote to all this. While the splendidly named ‘_Slime & Punishment_’ is consistent with the Waste’s previous output, the song-writing, musicianship and production are stronger and tighter than ever. I also feel there is more of a ‘crossover’ vibe here, certainly on tracks like the excellent ‘Shrednecks’ (how long before someone makes a horror movie with that title?). They are channelling their inner D.R.I.

Uplifting, happy and heavy – what more could you ask for?
