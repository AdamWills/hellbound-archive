When it comes to household Death Metal names, **Cannibal Corpse** has to be near the top. Despite lineup changes over the years the band has stayed relevant and continues to produce solid material. And if you’re one of “those” guys who say “Cannibal died when Chris Barnes left the band”, you need to get over that shit and move forward.

_Red Before Black_ is the latest record due out from the group on November 3rd via Metal Blade Records, and it’s a beautiful thing of brutality. If you enjoyed the 2014 release _Skeletal Remains_, then you are in for a real treat with this new album.

With OG members Alex (Webster) and Paul (Mazurkiewicz) on bass and drums respectively, you know the rhythm section is, and has always been, solid. Deep bass grooves and powerful drumming are on full display throughout this album. Another thing that stood out prominently to me was the dynamic changes of pace. _Red Before Black_ has a pace that is sort of unique: sheer chaos to neat grooves with Pat O’Brien’s sweeping guitar solos, truly a wonderful blend of sounds to heighten the experience for the listener.

Now, let’s talk about “Corpsegrinder” Mr. George Fisher: this guy is a Death Metal machine on vocals. Not too many highs, or lows, just constant power in every word he sings, or screams, should I say. And it’s just not on albums either, having seen the group a few times in the last two years, his stage vocals are equally powerful. Consistency is what I like in my artists and Corpsegrinder is as steady as they come.

With tracks entitled “Shedding My Human Skin”, “Heads Shoveled Off” and “Destroyed Without a Trace” you know what to expect – vicious, brutal, unapologetic Death Metal. No cutting corners, just plain and simple old fashioned, old school Floridian Death Metal, and that’s the best kind in my opinion.

_Red Before Black_ is the 14th full length release from Cannibal Corpse and is an awesome addition to their catalogue. With the last couple albums being as strong as they are I can’t see any reason why Cannibal Corpse couldn’t get that number to 20 albums. No signs of slowing down for these guys, and that’s a good thing for the Metal world.
