Three years on from the last **Kobra and the Lotus** album ‘_High Priestess_’, the band unleash their latest opus ‘_Prevail I_’, the title of which is a searing statement of intent. Kobra and the Lotus are here for the long haul, here to see trends come and go. They are all about a love for metal, for performance, for musicianship, for song-craft, for the fans. All the right reasons. I think, if anything, the three years between albums has made the band even stronger.

Kobra Paige is the band’s secret weapon, her strong voice and personality give the band their x-factor.

I personally feel this is a band whose time is nigh. Traditional heavy metal thrives in dark times like we live in now, and Kobra and the Lotus are a flame of molten metal in a world of man-made darkness.

_Long may they reign in fire!_
