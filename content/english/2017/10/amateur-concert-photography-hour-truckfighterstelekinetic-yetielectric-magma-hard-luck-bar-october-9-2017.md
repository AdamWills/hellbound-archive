Who wants to spend Thanksgiving with your folks when you can spend it with Truckfighters? Hitting Toronto for the [second time in nine months](https://hellbound.ca/2017/01/amateur-concert-photography-hour-truckfighterskings-destroy-hard-luck-bar-january-22-2017/), the Swedish stoner rock pilgrims brought plenty of good tidings and cheer on a balmy Monday night. The crowd was noticeably smaller than their previous appearance, but that didn't dampen the enthusiasm on this evening.

Local riff rock stalwarts [Electric Magma](http://www.electricmagma.com/) opened the show with a trademark fuzzy instrumental set, using the bass wah pedal to its full effect. These guys are currently working on their _ninth_ album and played us a few new tunes in the process.

[Telekinetic Yeti](https://telekineticyeti.bandcamp.com/releases) is a doomy duo from Iowa that blew their bass amp before their set even started. But despite the lack of low end, they still put on a spirited set with some Sleep-style stoner doom riffs. Their drummer could definitely win a Best Beards of Doom contest!

If these pictures are anything to go by, Truckfighters weren't quite as energetic as last time. Although I don't really remember it that way, with Dango adding a 360 and a jump kick to his arsenal of stage moves, and Ozo even getting in on the arial action. The highlight of the set had to be "Chameleon," a 10-minute tune from their second album, that made the ground shake with its heavy-as-balls intro. They mixed in a couple new songs as well, but those first two records, _Phi_ and _Gravity X_ are still where it's at!
