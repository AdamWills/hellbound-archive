Comprising members of Destruction (bassist and vocalist Schmier), and ex-Accept members Herman Frank on guitars and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann, you would expect the quality of the music from Panzer to be high and it is. Their fine debut album ‘_Send Them All To Hell_’ was more thrash-orientated, whereas the new album, though it will still appeal to fans of their debut, has a pronounced New Wave of British Heavy Metal influence. This can only be a good thing, and overall this album will appeal to a wide range of metal fans, featuring as it does, strong musicianship, strong songs, and a genuine enthusiasm for metal!
