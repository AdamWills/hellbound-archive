Bay Area Death Metal veterans **Exhumed** have a new release coming out October 13th via Relapse Records. It's entitled _Death Revenge_, and to put it in simplest terms, it’s brutal as fuck. What you know and appreciate (at least I have) is that Exhumed have always stayed pretty true to who they are, so you usually have a good idea of what you are going to get with new offerings from the band, and _Death Revenge_ does not disappoint.

This record is special and has instantly become one of my favorite releases of the 2017. Not only is the music some of the best they have written, it is a wonderful blend of  intense horrormovie like intros and traditional death metal riffs, but there are also some killer – KILLER – thrash riffs incorporated into the music as well. Don’t get me wrong, this is death metal all the way, but it comes with some great groove sections, sweeping guitar solos, and intense drumming and deep bass lines throughout.

Oh by the way, did I mention old school Exhumed member Ross Sewage is back in the band? This is the part of reviewing this album that instantly sold me; Ross’s deep guttural toned vocals backing up the familiar vocals of Matt Harvey is a match made in heaven (or Hell). The two vocalists have completely different singing styles, which makes the vocals that much more powerful. Matt and Ross’s vocals are a unique blend that works so incredibly well together it borders on being ridiculous.

It normally takes me a few listens to get a vibe on a new record and to really hear what the artist intended for me to hear. Not with _Death Revenge_. _Death Revenge_ is an album that I found enjoyable upon first listen. This album is straight up a prime example that good metal still is being made today regardless of what anybody says.

Exhumed brought their A game on this one and it shows. It starts with the musicianship, vocals, production, and right down to the order of the songs and how the album flows. Great job guys, you really outdid yourselves on this one. Horns WAY up!!
