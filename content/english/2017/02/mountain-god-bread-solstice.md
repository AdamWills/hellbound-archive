Brooklyn is probably not the first place that comes to mind when you think post-sludge. Me, I’m thinking Oakland, maybe Portland, definitely Chicago of late… But this trippy trio is coming straight outta Williamsburg on _Bread Solstice_, their debut LP, serving up six tracks in just over 40 minutes.

## Mountain God's Artificial Head debut

Some swirling riffs and heavy grooves get things underway on four-minute instrumental “Scaling the Silver Steps”—there’s some shades of Neurosis, Mammatus and maybe even Sleep. From there, the 11-and-a-half-minute “Nazca Lines” comes rolling up slowly, layering on some post-rock atmospherics, before hitting you with a heavy sludge riff and heavily distorted vocal about two-and-a-half minutes in. A rolling, chugging riff kicks in around 4:30, though tis but a brief respite from the oppressively heavy sludge attack. By the seven-minute mark, the screams turn to whispers, as the band takes a somewhat proggy turn. But then a moment of silence begets some of the slowest, heaviest riffs on this record, cutting through with a somewhat cleaner guitar tone. I think if Zoroaster was still going, they might sound something like this now.

The shorter, sludgier blast of “Karmic Truth” almost borders on black/death metal, with some particularly interesting drumbeats. But it still captures that blackened Midwest sludgy feel of an Indian or a Lord Mantis. “Junglenaut,” on the other hand, does not follow in the footsteps of “Supernaut” or “Dragonaut”—this one’s a bit of a snoozer, chockful of atmospheric effects. Likewise, “Unknown Ascent” sounds sorta like a post-rock take on _The Exorcist_ theme, with whispered black-metal vocals to boot!

Nine-minute album closing “Hymn to Nothing” brings back the heavy with a Cisneros-style bass line off the bat, though this number is probably more OM than Sleep. Still some pretty decent riffs, though.
