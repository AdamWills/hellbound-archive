Don’t get me wrong, I really dug those two records COC put out as a three-piece in the past five years… but just like southern cooking, it ain’t the same without Pepper. Mr. Keenan’s return injected [new life into some old tunes back in 2015](https://hellbound.ca/2015/12/amateur-concert-photography-hour-coc-brant-bjork-saviours-mothership/), and now they’ve finally returned with another new album, making up for lost time on this 15-song double LP.

After a brief instrumental opener sets the tone (there’s a lot of instro interludes on here, too), “The Luddite” comes crashing ‘n bashing in, an extra-hoarse Pepper Keenan vocal guiding the proceedings. The sludgy swing riff that begets the chorus wouldn’t sound outta place on an EHG record. Lead single “Cast the First Stone” would sound right at home on _Wiseblood_—I’m detecting a “Drowning in a Daydream” vibe here.

A killer, groovy, southern-fried riff kicks off “Wolf Named Crow,” another solid number in the _Wiseblood_/_Deliverance_ mould. Some of these new tracks should fit seamlessly into their live set! “Little Man” gets yer head nodding right from the get-go, while “Forgive Me” will have your feet tapping to its up-tempo chorus. “Nothing Left to Say” alternates between mellow, effects-laden verses and a heavy, hard-hitting chorus that really gets into your guts. This is how you do tempo changes, kids.

Man, I can’t stress enough that this record really sounds like they travelled 20 years back in time. Their last two albums can’t hold a candle to this one! OK, so the title track lacks impact, and there might be a few too many interludes, but when they set the dial to “rock” on this one, they simply melt faces.
