Byzantine are on tour in North America with label mates Sacred Reich, promoting their latest album _The Cicada Tree_. When the tour hit San Francisco earlier this month, Hellbound's Todd Owens sat down with Chris (OJ) Ojeda and Brian Henderson to talk touring, songwriting, influences, gear and more. Interested in which of these guys share an appreciation for not just Sacred Reich but also Tears for Fears and Hall & Oates? Curious about the metal scene in West Virginia? Want to know what happens when a metal tour is double-booked against a Disney act? Check out the interview here or on our Youtube channel.
