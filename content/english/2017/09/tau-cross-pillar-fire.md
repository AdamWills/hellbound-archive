For those who love Amebix’s excellent, original and heartfelt music, there is much to enjoy here. **Tau Cross** (also featuring Voivod’s excellent drummer Away) are something of a progression from Amebix, yet still very much in the same vein as that seminal band. Amebix were very much prophets without honour in their own land yet now are seen as what they were, a truly great band, with an influence far beyond their record sales. Tau Cross operates in the same vein, with perhaps more folk and even early gothic influences, yet as always the power remains. Strong musicianship, strong songs, and a from-the-heart sincerity: what more could you want?
