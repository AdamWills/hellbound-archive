Another Mastodon side-project, this time from Brann Dailor. Mastodon are so prolific they could start their own record label just featuring their own projects. Anyway, **Arcadea** has some resemblances to Mastodon as you’d expect, but it’s more 80s/electronic orientated, like Mastodon channelling Daft Punk.

The danger with electronic-orientated projects is they can noodle off into self-indulgent territories, sounding like a bad 80s VHS soundtrack. But Arcadea have strong songs and would appeal to fans of John Carpenter, Justice, Goblin, Perturbator and Zombi as well as Daft Punk, and of course, the ‘Don! Which rather is as it should be!

Clever, uplifting and with its 80s influences, in touch with the zeitgeist!
