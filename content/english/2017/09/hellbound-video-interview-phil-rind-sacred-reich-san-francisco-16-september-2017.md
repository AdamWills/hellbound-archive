After a 10-year break, and 21 years after their last new release, Sacred Reich are back on tour in North America, celebrating the 30th anniversary of _Ignorance_, their debut full-length album. Todd Owens snagged a few minutes of bassist/vocalist Phil Rind's time during the band's San Francisco tour stop. Watch on to see Phil's skills with the mic, to hear his politics and his surprise desert island picks, and to hear him thank Sacred Reich's loyal fans.
