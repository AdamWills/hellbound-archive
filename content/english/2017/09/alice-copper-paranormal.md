In a world gone mad (and going ever madder) it is ironic that Alice Cooper has turned out to be one of the sanest and most reliable men in it. Alice always gives his music 100%. After all these years he could hardly do less; he would only be besmirching his own legend. And, as always, Alice surrounds himself here with superb musicians.

Lyrically he’s on fire and in fine form. All the songs are as catchy as hell, which is as it should be with Alice. In a just world, Alice’s music would be dominating the airwaves. Mr Furnier for President, though he’s been on _The Muppet Show_ so maybe he feels he has already done that!

The two tracks featuring original Alice Copper band members here are a great attraction, but all the material holds up equally well, and guest appearances from Billy Gibbons and Roger Glover add to the _humanary stew_!

All in all, a fine album from one of the all time greats.
