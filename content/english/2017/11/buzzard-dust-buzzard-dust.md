**Buzzard Dust**, a genre blending band from Virginia, have crafted a solid debut record. (Full disclosure: the singer gave me a link to the record and I've known him for a number of years.) Buzzard Dust comprises various members of different bands, including Unsacred, Vorator, Psyopus and countless more. The record is a mix of speed, hardcore and straight up thrash.

The guitars are soaked in meth with a scoop full of southern hospitality. Rarely taking a breather, save for another toke and some groove, the record goes by quick.  All the best genres are here, most prominently to me is the speed.  Guitar solos abound but do not overtake – a nice addition to the overall music.  Drums are of the rabbit punching variety and keep the music speeding down the back roads of Virginia.  Lead signer Harrison Christy barks and screams his way through each song with aplomb.  There a number of guest appearances including Barney Greenway from Napalm Death, Kerry Zylstra from Occultist and Richard Johnson from Agoraphobic Nosebleed.

Overall an excellent debut for a new band made out of fairly good old bands.  Standout tracks include 3, 6, 9, 10.
