Eerily ethereal, beautifully brutal.  These are a few bits of dark matter that have slipped through the cracks of **Oranssi** **Pazuzu**'s ever expanding galaxy of recordings.

From the band via the 20 Buck Spin website: "Although not 'new' in every sense of the word - the first song ‘Kevät’ was recorded during Valonielu sessions in 2013, but left out from the album because its darker mood didn’t quite seem to fit in with the other songs’ more cosmic approach. The second, ‘Värimyrsky’, is also an older and more nihilistic one, that we have been playing with for a long time, and now finally decided to record it in our home cave with the help from our Brother-in-Wastement Jussi Saarivuori."

As that implies, this is hardly material for those who don't enjoy complexity.  From the very beginning this has been an act that pushes the limits of the mind.  These two tracks are even darker in tone than we've heard from them previously.  Yet as much as it's consciousness-bending and spacetime-warping stuff, it's still primarily utterly gorgeous.  Drawing power from the worlds of black metal and psychedelic rock, they launch into nebulous fits of ecstatic energy and then tumble back down and burrow into the earth before doing it all over again from the other side.  Enjoy the trip.
