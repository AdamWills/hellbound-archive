When **Akercocke** broke up in 2012, it was a sad loss for the metal scene, for they are that rarest of beasts, an original band with a unique vision (and I loved the suits!). Thankfully, five years on,Akercocke have returned.

It’s difficult to categorize their music, featuring as it does elements of black metal, death metal, traditional metal, doom metal, and I think the secret ingredient, progressive rock, for their music is intricate, deep and stirring. But, at the end of the day, it’s uniquely Akercocke, with Jason Jason Mendonça sounding truly like a man on a mission.

Highlight? Well, the album as a whole is a highlight. I especially loved ‘A Particularly Cold December’ and ‘Familiar Ghosts’.

The metal world needs Akercocke more than ever and it is good to have them back… Long may they reign.
