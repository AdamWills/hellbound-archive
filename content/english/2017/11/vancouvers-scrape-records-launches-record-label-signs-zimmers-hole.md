Vancouver has a new metal record label about to launch, albeit one with a very familiar name. **[Scrape Records](http://www.scraperecords.com)** was a long running metal record store, in existence from November 1, 1997 until 2016 catering to all forms of metal, that sadly closed its doors as a brick and mortar store and has only been an online metal mailorder for the past few years.

Scrape owner JJ has just announced today that Scrape is expanding once again, although in a different direction. Scrape Records is now becoming a full-blown record label and have announce that their first signings is long-running BC metal band **[Zimmer's Hole](https://www.facebook.com/The-Official-Zimmers-Hole-131005800305836/)**, a band featuring former members of **Strapping Young Lad** that was formerly signed to **Century Media Records**.

The plan is for the first release on Scrape Records the label to be Zimmer's Hole's recently completed new album _**Bound By Fire**_, tentatively scheduled for release in March, 2018. Today, on Scrape's 20th anniversary, they have announced the label and launched a new Indiegogo funding campaign to help kick-start the label. Please check the link below for more information.

Good luck to JJ and Scrape on this endeavour! We look forward to reviewing all of your upcoming releases
