Like a black metal Motorhead or the mutant offspring of New Wave of British Heavy Metal legends Tank, **WarCall** really live up to their name! Indeed the comparisons with Motorhead and Tank are apt as WarCall are a strong power trio. On this, their fourth album (following ‘_Demonarchy_’, ‘_Blood, Guts and Dirt_’, and ‘_III_’), they show themselves to be very much a 21st century band, with a strong groove in their music.

Intriguingly, ‘_Invaders_’ is a concept album about the human race fighting an alien invasion, and this gives the music a strong sense of purpose. Complemented by excellent cover art, this is an album with a strong sense of power and purpose overall.
