## WMBC band submissions open till December 29

If you've been following Wacken Metal Battle Canada at all, you likely know that things were on hold in 2017. Earlier this month, organizer JJ Tartaglia announced that the Canadian competition is back on for 2018, and WMBC has been taking band submissions since November 7.

Canadian bands have excelled here at home _and_ in the international battle, held yearly at [**Wacken Open Air**](https://www.wacken.com/en/) metal festival in Germany. Two Canadian bands have played their way to the top in Wacken Metal Battle International – **Crimson Shadows** in 2013 and **Vesperia** in 2015 – and another – **Profaner** – placed second in 2016. WMBC also sent Montreallers MUTANK to Germany in 2014.

### A few details from the November 7 news release

Crowning one Canadian champion from 2013 to 2016 to play Wacken Open Air, the world’s largest metal festival in Wacken, Germany, WACKEN METAL BATTLE CANADA returns for its fifth edition after a one year hiatus in 2017. ...

WMBC organizer JJ Tartaglia comments:

“We’re all very excited about the 2018 Metal Battle. After the pause from last year, we expect a good batch of quality submissions from across the country, both from existing bands that have been honing their craft, and from new bands that have emerged during the break. We’ve also made some tweaks to the round structure which will include a Western Final and Eastern Final leading up to the grand finale in Toronto. So it will be more of a hockey playoff style, which I think will work out better, with the Final being technically on neutral ground.”

Submissions for the 2018 battles will open on November 7th, 2017 and close on December 29th, 2017 at 11:59pm EST. Bands interested in participating can apply at the following link: [http://metalbattle.ca/apply.html](http://metalbattle.ca/apply.html).
