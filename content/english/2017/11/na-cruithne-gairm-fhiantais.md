Hailing from the mighty land of Galway in Ireland, **Na Cruithne** meld traditional Irish music with heavy metal, showing a skill and love for this music seldom seen. Often in folk metal, one element overwhelms the other, but not so here. Na Cruithne’s music is a new beast, one extremely pleasing to the ear and, indeed, to the neck! All the musicians acquit themselves well, playing as a single organic entity, the sum even greater than the parts.

I have seen Na Cruihne live several times, most recently at Bad Reputation Limerick’s tenth anniversary gigs. They are an excellent band live, and visually arresting, bringing to mind a cross between Pat Mills’ ‘_Slaine_’ graphic novels and Braveheart. The lads and ladies of the band look like they stepped out of the pages of Jim Fitzpatrick’s ‘_Erinsaga_’…make no mistake, Na Cruithne are true **_Woad Warriors_**!

This is a truly excellent album, artwork and production complementing to the maximum degree. Na Cruithne would be a great addition to any major metal label’s roster. Like the stories that inspire them from the Celtic myths and legends, one day Na Cruihne themselves will be legends!
