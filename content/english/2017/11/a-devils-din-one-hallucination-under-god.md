Montreal psychedelic power trip **A Devil’s Din** continues to impress with this, their wittily titled third album. It is a timeless album, one with a great sense of fun and humour. Indeed, unlike so much of today’s music, it is positively positive! Multi-instrumentalist David Lines is truly a man born out of time (as the great John Carpenter memorably wrote). His creativity is staggering and he definitely belongs to era when music was more treasured and explored. The bass playing of Thomas Chollet and the drumming of Dom Salameh provide a strong structure for the cosmic travelling of A Devil’s Din.

Fans of The Beatles, Syd-era Floyd and The Doors will find much to love here, but the band A Devil’s Din remind me most of is Masters of Reality circa ‘_The Blue Garden_’. Yes indeed, in a just world A Devil’s Din would be huge and perhaps, in some psychedelic parallel Earth, they are!
