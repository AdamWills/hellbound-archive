Once more, an independent band puts higher profile bands to shame. **Lung Flower** play seriously heavy groove metal in the vein of Pantera and Black Label Society. The packaging and art for this CD shows a commendable commitment to the physical product of music, and for that they should be applauded.

The production is clear and powerful; it has the kind of weight this music requires. Their playing is first-class and the songs come from the heart, not afraid to mine honest raw emotion.

_A band to watch._
