This was truly a pleasure to review – songs, musicianship, production, everything is as it should be!

**Woodhawk** have taken some very good influences: Mastodon, Thin Lizzy, Budgie, Hawkwind, Monster Magnet and, of course… Kyuss. (I often think of some alternative universe where Kyuss never broke up…a splendid thought indeed!)

Not so much in sound, but in terms of song-writing, Woodhawk have something in common with Blue Oyster Cult.

The title track really sums up Woodhawk’s strengths. It comes across as a synthesis of Mastodon (circa _Crack The Skye_) and Kyuss circa their spacey, proggy _Welcome To Sky Valley._ I just love this track; everything is just right, a really catchy song with a very modern mid-section.

Amazingly, this is a power-trio! You’d think there were at least six fellows in the band. Of course, look at how many classic bands were, for all or part of their existence, power-trios: Cream, Motorhead, Venom, Tank, Celtic Frost, Budgie...

If people still paid for their records (but don’t, in a case of burning down the house while you’re still under its roof!), "The High Priest" would be a huge hit single.

As a third highlight, I pick ‘Living In The Sand’, where the power trio format really allows every instrument it’s space.

Superb. This is what happens when records are made for all the right reasons.
