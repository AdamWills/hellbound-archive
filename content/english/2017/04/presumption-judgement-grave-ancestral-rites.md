Doom metal from France... tres bon! Presumption put many bands to shame with a unique sound that, while it draws from the likes of Cathedral and Trouble, builds on these influences. It’s always more authentic to hear a band sing in their native tongue, as on the excellent ‘La Meffraye’. All the tracks are great, but the highlight is the splendidly named ‘Anvil Devil’, which name-checks Aleister Crowley. Elsewhere, tracks like ‘Samsara’ lay down the law of doom as the whole of the law! A band that deserve a much wider audience; killer album artwork too!

(Self-Released, 2014)

French doomsters Presumption are one of metal’s great secrets, but not for much longer! After the excellent _From Judgement To The Grave_ release, they returned in 2016 with a new EP. _Ancestral Rites_ features three new studio song, and two live tracks. The three new songs – ‘Broken Eyes, ‘Ancestral Rites’ and ‘Astral Death’ – are a marked progression from their previous release, excellent as it was. The band is tight; this is a real band, not a Facebook ‘project’ (careful now, down with that kind of thing!). The songs are first class, the band locking together like a single entity. The splendidly named singer Moomoot has a truly original voice, and the diversity of Presumption’s material is impressive – they’re not afraid to go from a heavy passage to a subtle one. They really have that Cathedral/Black Sabbath spirit – the songs really are that good. Kudos to the analogue production, no pro-tools trash here! The two live tracks, ‘Albert Fish Blues’ and ‘Dr. Satan’, show Presumption to be electric on stage. Hopefully we’ll see them play on other shores sometime soon.
