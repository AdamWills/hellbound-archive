Earlier this month Exodus invaded San Francisco to headline two back-to-back nights of heavy metal mayhem at The Chapel. Hellbound's Mean Gene Gaona and Todd Owens were there and got a chance to hang out with one of the bands joining Exodus on July 8th: EXMORTUS. The conversation covered a lot of ground, from touring Europe and songwriting to classical music, music soundtracks, and the joys of being fantasy and horror geeks. Check it out below or through our [Hellbound YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ORrPGrqJlX4RMMMxHMntw).
