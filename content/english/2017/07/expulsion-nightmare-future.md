Do you like grindcore? How about fast and extreme? Well, take your blood pressure medication and hit play. **Expulsion**’s highly anticipated album _Nightmare Future_ drops on July 10th via Relapse Records and it is brutal!

The band consists of grind/metal veterans Matt Olivo (Repulsion), Matt Harvey (Exhumed, Gruesome), Danny Walker (Intronaut, Exhumed, Phobia), and Menno Verbaten (Lightning Swords of Death). This group of musicians managed to put together a first album consisting of seven songs and clocking in around 13 minutes (I told you to take your blood pressure meds).

With song titles like “Total Human Genocide”, “Altar of Slaughter”, and “Nightmare Future”, you should know what to expect. _Nightmare Future_ is a brutal, violent, high octane rollercoaster ride through hell. Wicked guitar riffs, super raw bass lines, fantastically fast drumming and the dark heavy vocals we have come to know and love from Matt Harvey.

If you like no nonsense, no messing around, rip your head off and melt your face brutal metal, Expulsion’s _Nightmare Future_ is just what the doctor ordered. You can tell this group had no time to waste and got straight to the point of making a ripper of an album. My only hope is to see them play this live someday. Great work guys, horns up!
