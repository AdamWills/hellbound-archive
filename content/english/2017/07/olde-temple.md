They say that wisdom comes with age, and this quintet of Toronto scene vets are moving further along the path of enlightenment with _Temple_, their second album.  The record kicks off with “Subterfuge,” a mid-paced sludgy stomp with a couple shades of Crowbar, particularly in the vocal department. “Now I See You” injects some southern-style COC grooves into the mix, while “The Ghost Narrative” slows things down considerably, a downtrodden pace that continues onto the seven-and-a-half-minute title track.

That said, their sound is fairly consistent throughout. “Centrifugal Disaster” picks up the pace somewhat, but it’s still the same familiar tempos and tones, with some super-heavy breakdowns through in for good measure. The bluesy opening riff of “Maelstrom” reminds me of Sons of OTIS—the two bands share a drummer—but it’s also got a few sludge breaks as well, while “Castaway” is a bit more mellow, leading to sort of a post-sludge attack. Not that there’s anything wrong with that—in fact, there’s something to be said for a steadily solid listen. With age comes experience too, eh?
