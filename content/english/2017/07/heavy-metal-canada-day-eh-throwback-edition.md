Here at Hellbound it's been our practice to honour our Canadian origins with regular celebrations of Canadian heavy metal. We do this every year's end with our top Canadian albums lists, but we also do this every July 1, Canada Day, when we Canucks celebrate our nation's birthday. This year's post is, in part, a look back at much of the Canadian metal we have celebrated in the past, but it's also a glimpse of some of the Canadian history you can find in Canadian metal.

## Canadian metal favourites according to Hellbound

### Favourite Canadian metal album (2009):

This list was too open for much consensus, but the artist named the most often was... **VOIVOD**.

## But there's more.

This year Canada, as a political entity, turns 150. It's a nice round number but doesn't, of course, encapsulate the history of human activity on these lands and, clearly, fails to honour the peoples here long before European colonization. We can't correct this with a simple post on a metal site, but we can draw attention to where Canadian metal has tried to engage with the history of this land and the political institutions that have been erected upon it.

**Ahna** – "Colony"

"From across the sea / He finds a land to claim his own..."

Happy Canada Day. Let's celebrate what's great about this country, but let's also remember that it hasn't been great here for everyone. And, while we're at it, why not imagine how Canada could be even better.
