Although they built this city on blues ‘n BBQ, I can’t really think of any good music that’s come out of Memphis in the past 30 years or so. So when I heard about this heavy duo Namazu, I was certainly intrigued. Not to be confused with the [Aussie drone duo](https://namazu1.bandcamp.com/) (or the equally [Aussie death metal quintet](https://soundcloud.com/namazuband)) of the same name, this outfit takes its moniker from Japanese mythology, while its riffs sometimes sound like they’re coming from across the pond—Sweden, to be precise.

_Works Cited_ starts off with a three-and-a-half-minute number called “Bactine” that sounds like pure Truckfighters worship, even in the vocal department. But rather than running out of fuel, Namazu stretches things out with “Gunwhale,” a slightly mellower, but equally Swedish-sounding tune, with perhaps an added dash of Red Fang. “Dragged Fighting from His Tomb” actually has a bit of an Iron Maiden vibe, despite having just one guitarist, with a riff slightly reminiscent of “Fear of the Dark.”

“The Sportswriter” is more of a noise-rock number a la Big Business. I was intrigued by the lyrics, but it sounds like they’ve got nothing to do with the Grizzlies. “Waterwalkers” also has a bit more of a jagged edge, clocking in just shy of six minutes, before “Bright Boy” brings things back toward Sweden by way of Fu Manchu, with maybe a Metallica riff thrown in for good measure. By contrast, the two-and-a-half-minute “Kootenai” pretty much screams Red Fang, or even Black Wizard, for that matter.

In any case, this album was able to capture my attention for a full 40 minutes—about the time it takes me to polish off a couple racks of ribs. ;)
