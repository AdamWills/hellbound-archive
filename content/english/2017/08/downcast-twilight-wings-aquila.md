Hailing from Russia, but with lyrics in English, **Downcast Twilight** are most accomplished musicians and could compete on any international stage. Their song-writing is strong, the tracks all cover various periods in history, and clearly a lot of work has gone into their production.

It is death metal with folk influences, but really it has the sincerity of Bathory and doesn’t really fit any specific metal genre. If anything, it’s very diverse, and features a superb production.

It speaks highly for Russia if it can produce bands of this ilk.
