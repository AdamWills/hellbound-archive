That title is a very fair description of Motorhead. They certainly were beer drinkers and hell raisers… especially in their golden years, the time of the Three Amigos line-up: Lemmy, Fast Eddie, and Philthy Phil!

They were even on programs like _TISWAS_ and _Top of the Pops_, and the public knew them through quotes from Lem like, ‘I came from a broken home… I broke it!’ or ‘If we moved next door to you, your lawn would die!’

Just reading this book made me happy; it really does cover a special time, and Martin Popoff captures it well. It is no exaggeration to say that he is the James Brown of rock journalism – he is the hardest working man!

Popoff brings a wealth of experience to a book that is extensive, fair (both sides of the story given by members who left/were fired), but always fun to read. I feel also that its focus on the golden years removes some of the melancholy of Lemmy’s still raw to us all death. I get the feeling that Martin knows all the material in the book from first-hand experience; it has that fly on the wall vibe.

There is also a strong contribution from Fast Eddie, now the last amigo, the last one standing of the classic line-up, who says, and it sums Motorhead up well: “I have too many regrets to go into now but overall I think I have been very fortunate to have met and played with all the people I have. I do not think I would change a thing, as I would not risk losing the music and the memories I have. Whatever happens I have no complaints.”

Visually, it’s a beautifully designed book, with a terrific assortment of photos.

Overall, one of the best books on Motorhead. Two further books I could see Martin Popoff doing a grand job of would be a book on Lemmy’s legendary Hawkwind years, and a bio of Fast Eddie, who I feel really deserves one.
