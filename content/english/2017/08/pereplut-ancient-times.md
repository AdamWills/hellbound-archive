Pagan folk metal from Russia. I don’t understand the lyrics but the music is excellent. It does conjure up images of a world where Baba Yaga waits for the unexpected in a darkened forest. Production and musicianship is first class, at times melancholy but most cheerful… like a Russian Skyclad or Mael Mhordha. Love the cover artwork too, very evocative of times past. All in all, a very good folk metal album, and special in its unique Russian identity.
