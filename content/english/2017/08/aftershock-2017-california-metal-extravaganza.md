Last year Hellbounder Gene A. Gaona covered **Aftershock** for [Capital Chaos TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMQ-roD6CWGyg-xzWIqNXQ) – and interviewed **Igor** & **Max Cavalera**:

This year, the sixth annual **Monster Energy Aftershock** festival will feature headliners like Nine Inch Nails, Ozzy Osbourne with Zakk Wylde, A Perfect Circle, Five Finger Death Punch, Run The Jewels, Stone Sour, Marilyn Manson, and Mastodon and is primed to sell out once again. We're looking forward to providing an insider view of the 2017 festivities here at Hellbound, thanks to Gene and cameraman Todd Owens.

In the meantime, here's a personal shout out (though I'll be looking on from afar) – one of Aftershock's partners this year is an organization called **[Take Me Home](http://www.takemehome.tv/)**:

"Take Me Home (TMH) has been saving the lives of homeless animals since 2001. TMH was founded as an animal rights advocacy foundation saving orphaned animals and striving to end animal overpopulation. TMH works in conjunction with shelters and rescues throughout California and beyond to help save animals on death row, on the streets, or in unsafe living conditions. Stop by their booth for custom gear and contribute to a great cause."

Monster Energy AFTERSHOCK 2017 takes place October 21-22 at Discovery Park in Sacramento. To find out more:
