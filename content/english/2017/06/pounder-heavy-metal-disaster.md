What can you say: Matt Harvey is one busy artist. If trying to juggle his other bands Dekapitator, Exhumed, and Gruesome wasn’t enough, he goes and offers us this new project entitled **Pounder**.

Pounder's first EP release, _Heavy Metal Disaster_, is a refreshing throw back to the good old days of power metal, heavy metal or even heavy rock. Right away it took me back to the mid-80’s and it made me think of some of the greats like Judas Priest or Iron Maiden. With some sing along choruses, dual guitars jamming perfectly in sync, you can’t help but be transported back to when metal was truly King. And don’t let me forget Matt’s vocals: forget what you think you know about his usual death metal vocal stylings, this dude can really sing.

It goes without saying that I love metal. I really love newer metal that makes me feel comfortable, like I have heard it before. Pounder is just that. It has all the makings of comfort music because it sounds so familiar, but yet refreshing. We all know Matt Harvey is a talented musician, but I would have never expected something like this from him. Pounder is good old fashioned party music. Have a few friends over, light up the BBQ, crack open some beers and just turn it up.
