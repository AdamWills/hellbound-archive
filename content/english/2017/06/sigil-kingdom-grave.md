**Sigil** have produced a most assured debut. Influenced by the likes of Discharge, Entombed, Black Breath, Death, Immolation and Morbid Angel, Sigil are ploughing their own furrow. A pleasing aspect to this album is the crusty sound to the riffs. I was reminded of the likes of Doom here; these are some seriously dense and effective riffs. Overall, this album builds on its foundations to create a cohesive body of strong songs, an album that bodes well for Sigil, a band that should have longevity.
