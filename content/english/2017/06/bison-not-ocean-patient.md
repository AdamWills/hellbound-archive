Album number four from the band formerly known as **Bison** B.C. has been nearly five years in the making. Since the release of their last record, they’ve been dropped from Metal Blade, replaced their bassist and issued a lone, two-track, digital-only single… so you might say they’ve fallen off the map. Can this record re-establish the most influential outfit from the East Van sludge scene?

_You are Not the Ocean…_ begins with more of a post-sludge note in “Until the Earth is Empty,” with the heavy riffs initially intermingled with some cleaner guitar tones. That’s not to say this number doesn’t pack a punch—the driving verse sounds like vintage Bison, and there’s no shortage of heavy breakdowns, either, with them notably picking up the pace for a shredding solo right around the four-minute mark. “Anti War” is a three-minute burst of thrashing, churning breakdowns, culminating in a hard-pounding chorus, before “Drunkard” tunes it down a notch with some crunchy, heavy sludge that borders on noise-rock territory à la Unsane or Today is the Day.

The seven-and-a-half minute “Tantrum” throws in a few more post-metal flourishes, including a rogue violin, but at its core, 'tis still a heavy vegetable. “Raiigin” might be the heaviest tune on this one, even incorporating the fiddle into its downtuned despondency, before picking up the pace past the two-minute mark. Both a step forward and a return to form, Bison is back, baby!
