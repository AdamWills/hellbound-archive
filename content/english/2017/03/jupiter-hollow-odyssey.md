I am very impressed by this EP on any level. Sounding, to my mind, like a cross between Rush, Zombi, and Mastodon, this is progressive metal as it should be. Grant MacKenzie and Kenny Parry, the two men that make up **Jupiter Hollow,** can be proud of this EP. It features strong playing, excellent song-writing, and above all, it is most uplifting, something we really need in this day and age.

A band to look out for in the future.
