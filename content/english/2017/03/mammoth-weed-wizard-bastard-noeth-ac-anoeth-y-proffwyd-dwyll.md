## Noeth Ac Anoeth

It is increasingly rare to hear a band with their own unique sound, but the splendidly named **Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard** are just such a band. Wielding huge doom riffs and drums along with the astonishing vocals of Jessica Ball, they have a superb sound, aided by the sterling work of Conan producer Chris Fielding.

Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard have a lot in common with bands like Sleep, but also, in terms of musical adventure, they owe a lot to the mighty Hawkwind.

Epic and original!

## Y Proffwyd Dwyll

Topping their previous _Noeth Ac Anoeth_ album is some feat but the splendidly named Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard have done it, an achievement as seismic as their plate tectonic shaking riffs… riffs that truly could create earthquakes and move mountains.

All writers try to make comparisons to give the reader an idea of what a band sounds like, one that flashes through my head is Jane Weaver fronting Sleep, but truly that is only a reference point, for MWWB are very much their own creation.

Jess Ball’s vocals are ethereal and cosmic, with a dreamlike storytelling quality. Her beautiful voice is truly original, and this is juxtaposed against the most heavy riffs since giant Iommis, Wards and Butlers walked the Earth (Earth being Sabbath’s prior name, so this is as it should be).

On this album the influence of Hawkwind is ever present not so much in sound but in spirit of the age. (Hawkwind are truly superb, and I could not recommend them more.) There is also the influence of one of my all time heroes John Carpenter; his music provides a similar pulse to his movies as MWWB’s do to their sonic dreamscapes.

Singing in their own native language really works and is lovely to hear; I can’t imagine them doing otherwise. It would be interesting to hear them cover some of their influences’ songs but in Welsh.

Original, sincere, skull-crushing, and beautiful, important music from a band that truly matter, that truly make music for all the right reasons.
