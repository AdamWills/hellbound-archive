Ever encountered a moment when, through no fault of its own, an album just seems to go under-appreciated and/or just generally taken for granted, reader? It's not an incredibly common occurrence, but it does happen; every so often, an album will suffer because it really just feels like “more of the same,” no matter how good it might be. For **The Chemical Brothers**, that album was _Come With Us_, their fourth full-length release. After the successes of both _Dig Your Own Hole_ and _Surrender_, the group's fan base was established and waiting for something new. But when _Come With Us_ arrived (three years after _Surrender_), fans simply did not respond with the same excitement that they had previously. Critics were positive and sales were respectable, but it just felt as though there was something missing from _Come With Us_ and that translated to a diminished return.

Even now, fifteen years after its original release, it's difficult to shake the “Yup – it's another Chemical Brothers album” vibe from _Come With Us_ as the title track opens the A-side of the Astralwerks reissue. Right off, the vocal part (“Come with us – and leave your Earth behind/ Bright and clear, we see the light/ Our universe is at your side, please lead us to other suns more ripe/ Behold!”) can't stop itself from feeling a little trite and “done” because it just moves so stiffly. When the beat kicks in, the going gets slightly more palatable, but not much, and it still feels like an awful lot of wind-up without much of delivery, and the album stays that course through “It Began In Afrika” – although the energy at least picks up a little there with the help of some great polyrhythmic samples and increased tempo.

The dichotomy between those two opening songs proves to be a simple one that The Chemical Brothers would start using regularly on future releases; the build comes from the first cut and is then followed by a more frenetic follow-up in order to try and get some blood rushing. It works here, by degrees, but there's no question that The Chemical Brothers would get better at it than is expressed in this introduction.

... Unfortunately, what the group wouldn't do is get better at it on this album. As each side progresses, the songs seem to get longer and, while there are some strong cuts (“My Elastic Eye” remains a personal favorite, but “Star Guitar” and the Richard Ashcroft-enriched track “The Test” continue to play pretty well), the longer drags are more regularly apparent – even intensified by the fact that the highs on this album aren't even as good as the average ones on either _Dig Your Own Hole_ or _Surrender_. That problem is still apparent now, fifteen years later.

And, as was true fifteen years ago, it remains important to reiterate that _Come With Us_ isn't a _bad_ album, just that it doesn't stand up as well as it could have were it not the one which was released after _Dig Your Own Hole_ and _Surrender_. It's still easy to overlook _Come With Us_ when one thinks about the heights to which The Chemical Brothers ascended in the 1990s which is a shame. Equally unfortunate is the fact that this album would eventually prove to be the first in a series of slumps for the group; comparatively, while _Come With Us_ has its problems, it still stands above _Push The Button_ and _We Are The Night_ for quality within the group's catalogue.
