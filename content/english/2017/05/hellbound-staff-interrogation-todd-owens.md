Hellbound first ran a series of staff interrogations to celebrate our second anniversary. Since then we’ve published a lot more metal coverage (and a little non-metal too), and our contributor list has continued to evolve. As we approach another birthday, this time marking eight years in action, we figured it was time to properly introduce some of the newer blood to our readers. Read the fourth installment of ‘Staff Interrogations, Revisited’ below.
