Hellbound first ran a series of staff interrogations to celebrate our second anniversary. Since then we’ve published a lot more metal coverage (and a little non-metal too), and our contributor list has continued to evolve. As we approach another birthday, this time marking eight years in action, we figured it was time to properly introduce some of the newer blood to our readers. Read the second installment of 'Staff Interrogations, Revisited' below.

**Location:**  Peterborough, ON

**How did you get into metal reviewing and interviewing?**

Talking music with Laura Wiebe at a Brock University CPCF \[Communication, Popular Culture and Film\] function. Our conversation moved to writing about music, at which point Laura offered me an opportunity to write content for Hellbound. I don’t know if I have ever thanked her for this, so thank you, Laura !

**What’s your favourite piece of metal journalism?**

I have recently been checking out some stuff on Youtube, particularly “Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction” by Loudwire and “Artist vs Shazam” from Metal Injection. They are fun and more casual interviews with bands and personalities that inform viewers and humanize metal celebrities. I also have to give kudos to _Metal Hammer_ and _Revolver_. I read these magazines in my formative years, and they exposed me to a lot of metal music I would have never heard of otherwise. They also gave me my first taste of heavy metal journalism.

**Heavy metal, thrash, black, death or doom?**

It ain’t worth my cash if it ain’t got that thrash. Love the speed, love the shredding guitars, and I just gotta support a genre that originated in North America (I still love what you do, Europe).

**What are some of your best concert memories?**

Two parter. My first metal concert was an Ozzfest detour show. Mudvayne headlined a show with Shadows Fall, In Flames, and a young Trivium on on of their first major tours. I had been to concerts before, but nothing compared to the electricity and energy in the air at a metal show; it really is one of a kind. There was one issue with this show, however - In Flames had equipment issues so they only played a couple of songs before giving up. Fast forward one year to me back in Toronto to see In Flames headline with a slightly older Trivium, DevilDriver and Zao. DevilDriver was shooting a DVD so I am probably in that, and In Flames referenced the Mudvayne show and promised to make it up to us that night. I am fairly certain they played every song they had ever written.

**Best interview you’ve done do far?**

My one and only, [Sean Yseult](https://hellbound.ca/2015/04/the-dark-side-of-the-big-easy-interview-with-sean-yseult/). Super cool and interesting woman. Multi-talented, humble, and I really wish I could have taken her up on her offer to see her gala in New Orleans. Exams make international travel difficult.

**Interview you’d most like to score?**

Devin Townsend. Long extraordinary career, too many albums to count, ranging from the serious to the absurd (an alien calling for the destruction of Earth over coffee, anyone?). From interviews I’ve seen with him he seems like a blast to interact with. Bonus points for being Canadian. Bonus bonus points for being a Canadian beloved on all hospitable continents.

**The most underrated metal artist is:**

3 Inches of Blood (I have never had someone ever bring them up in music conversation). I will fight anyone to the death who doesn’t think “Deadly Sinners” is the greatest song ever written.

The most underrated metal album is:

_Wavering Radiant_ by Isis. _Oceanic_ gets all of the praise, but I just got lost in the sound when I listen to _WR_. Interesting and creative tracks, and perfect from start to finish. I have lost or broken more copies of this album than I care to admit.

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?**

In no particular order:- _Wavering Radiant_ by Isis:  See underrated album.
- _L.D 50_ by Mudvayne:  There was a point in my life where I listened to this album everyday. I will never tire of this album.
- _Languages_ by The Contortionist:  To take away the stress of being stuck in limbo for eternity.
- _Lateralus_ by Tool:  Needed one Tool album on this list, and I’ll probably be dead before they release another one.
- _Epicloud_ by Devin Townsend Project:  This could have been nearly any Strapping Young Lad or Devin Townsend Band/Project album. _Epicloud_ just happens to be the last one I listened to which makes it my temporary favourite.
