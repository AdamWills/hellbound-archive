Hailing from Venezuela, **Nocturnal Hollow** are a death metal band that in the future will be known far beyond their own borders. They have taken their influences, Death, Celtic Frost, Morbid Angel and given them their own unique sheen. Their song-writing is first-class, indeed there is a lot of traditional metal in their leads and arrangements. This is greatly aided by a fine production from Dan Swano, warm and with great brutality and clarity. The artwork and packaging is excellent too. Now, let’s get them to Europe!
