Having seen Limerick’s **Zealot Cult** play an excellent set at [Siege of Limerick](http://siegeoflimerick.net/), I had high expectations for this three-track EP, and I wasn’t disappointed.

The title track shows a strong grasp of song-writing craft; the song is intricate and yet economic at the same time, clever but not cluttered. Most pleasing of all is a strong grasp of dynamics, and change of pace. On the remaining two tracks, ‘Eternal Winter’ and ‘Suffocation of the Mind’, Zealot Cult shows a similar set of song-writing skills. Playing-wise, the band’s live work has paid off, their music having a strong unity and organic feel to it, some truly virtuoso guitar work there, but again it serves the song rather than the player, and all the band are similarly skilled. I hear no weak links here courtesy of a strong production. Excellent artwork from the talented Ken Coleman too. _Karmenian Crypt_ looks as good as it sounds.

Zealot Cult are to be commended for their commitment to the physical form of music and getting it into shops and shows. For a full-length album they would be a strong investment for any record label.

One to watch!
