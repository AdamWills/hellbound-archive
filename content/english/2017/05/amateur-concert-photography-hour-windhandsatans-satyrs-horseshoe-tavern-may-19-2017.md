Sometimes it's good to have a bill where all the bands don't sound exactly the same. Both Satan's Satyrs and Windhand hail from Virginia, and would certainly appeal to a doom-minded audience, but there are very few sonic similarities between them. While one sounds like the second coming of a semi-obscure 70's proto-metal outfit, the other is sort of what Sleep would sound like with a frontwoman--and lemme just say, they're a huge improvement in the vocal department. I was looking forward to seeing both bands individually, so sticking 'em on the same bill was basically a double bonus.

Alas, while I missed the first of two local openers, I did get to hear all of [Pale Mare](https://palemareband.bandcamp.com/releases)'s set. This band comes from the same lineage as Godstopper and Ayahuasca, two top-notch local sludge/noise acts, which can be traced back to a mid-aughts outfit called The Womb (their guitar player plays drums in Pale Mare). Of the three, this band sounds the most like its predecessor, with a punishing sludgy hardcore approach. To date, they only have one song posted on Bandcamp, but I hope to hear more from them soon!

As there was a pretty decent-sized crowd at the Horseshoe, I had to squeeze my way to the front for Satan's Satyrs, but I ended up with a prime vantage point as per usual. Originally a power trio, they added a second guitarist sometime before their [appearance at Psycho Las Vegas](https://hellbound.ca/2016/09/psycho-las-vegas-day-one-recap/), which really takes their sound to the next level. And while they were maybe not quite as crazy as I remembered in the heat of the Vegas night, this band's still got stage presence in spades!

From the first time I saw Windhand, back in 2014, I knew this was a band that doesn't simply stare at their shoes. Their heavy riffs get heads nodding throughout the building, and that does not exclude the players on stage. If anything, they seemed a little more restrained than they were on their first two trips to Toronto, but that's not to say they stood still. And while they played as loud as _un phoque en Virginia_, the vocals cut more cleanly through the mix than I think I've ever heard...which is clearly a key component of their sound. For my money's worth, Windhand and Witch Mountain are the two top female-fronted doom bands going--and after that, it's not even close!
