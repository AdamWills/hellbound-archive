Hellbound first ran a series of staff interrogations to celebrate our second anniversary. Since then we’ve published a lot more metal coverage (and a little non-metal too), and our contributor list has continued to evolve. As we approach another birthday, this time marking eight years in action, we figured it was time to properly introduce some of the newer blood to our readers. Read the third installment of ‘Staff Interrogations, Revisited’ below.

**Location:** Northern California/Bay Area

**How did you get into metal reviewing and interviewing?**

My friend Zoran of [Capital Chaos TV](https://capitalchaostv.com/) asked me if I'd like to join his staff to do possible concert reviews, album reviews and sometimes on-camera interviews.

**How did you get involved with Hellbound?**

I have been friends with Adam Wills for close to 10 years and thought I might be a good fit for the site he and his lovely lady Laura Wiebe keep running.

**What’s your favourite piece of metal journalism?**

As much as I like to review new albums there is no bigger rush than to do on-camera interviews with some of my favourite artists.

**Heavy metal, thrash, black, death or doom?**

I’m a Thrash guy with classic Death Metal a close second.

**What are some of your best concert memories?**

Any time I have seen Iron Maiden, as well as working for CCTV at Aftershock 2016, where I got the chance to meet some of my favourite bands like Slayer and Anthrax.

**Best interview you’ve done so far?**

The two that stick out most to me are Max and Igor Cavalera, and Donald Tardy from Obituary.

**Interview you’d most like to score?**

Iron Maiden, Slayer, Anthrax, Six Feet Under, Philip Anselmo, Lamb of God.

**The most underrated metal artist is:**

Exodus – as popular as they are with some people I think they are overlooked by a lot. After all these years they still put out quality Thrash records and have a better sound than other “older” or newer bands.

**The most underrated metal album is:**

_Tempo Of The Damned_ by Exodus.

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?**

Iron Maiden: _Seventh Son of a Seventh Son_ Led Zeppelin: _II_I Slayer: _Show No Mercy_ Anthrax: _Among The Living_ Creedence Clearwater Revival: _Greatest Hits_
