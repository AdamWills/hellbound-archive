Twas a doomy May Two-Four two-fer this weekend, as another pre-MDF tour rolled through town. I first caught Conan last year on their _Revengeance_ tour, and in terms of sheer volume, they are one of the loudest bar bands I've ever seen. Coming over from the U.K., they needed an (almost) equally as heavy trio to share a backline, and [Arizona outfit North](http://northband.us/) fit the description.

I really dug [North's _Metanoia_ EP](https://hellbound.ca/2014/05/north-metanoia-ep/) from a couple years back, although I totally missed their album that came out last year on Prosthetic. Either way, it was pretty cool to see a band that came from quite a ways away, and their heavy, melodic blend of post-sludge set the stage for Conan.

Conan had a different touring lineup this time around; bringing bassist Chris Fielding out on the road added another dimension to their sound, particularly in the vocal department. They delivered one helluva heavy set over 60 minutes for which earplugs provided inadequate protection, engulfing The Garrison in a massive wall of sound. I can't think of a better way to spend a Sunday!
