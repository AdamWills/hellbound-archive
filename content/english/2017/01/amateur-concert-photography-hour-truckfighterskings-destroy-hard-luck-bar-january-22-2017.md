The last time I saw Truckfighters live was at a battleaxe-throwing ground for a Sailor Jerry's sponsored gig. The place was packed, the show was late, and I didn't get outta there until 1:30. Fast-forward a couple years, and they're playing a proper venue with proper touring support in support of [a somewhat low-key record](https://hellbound.ca/2016/09/truckfighters-v/). But I'll be damned if that wasn't the biggest crowd I've even seen at the Hard Luck, dude!

Although there was a couple local openers before them, [Kings Destroy](http://www.kingsdestroy.com/) really got the ball rolling with their high-energy epic-doom set. And if you think that's an oxymoron, you obviously haven't seen Kings Destroy, erm, destroy in the live setting. They even chucked in [their new 14-minute tune](https://hellbound.ca/2017/01/kings-destroy-none/) without losing any momentum--which is saying something, since most doom tunes that long are generally just three riffs and a cloud of smoke.

Suffice to say, Truckfighters don't believe in resting on the Sabbath. Their sweaty Sunday-night set featured no shortage of on-stage acrobatics--mostly on the part of Dango, Sweden's answer to Angus Young. But they all entertained, and the new drummer kept the energy level high...even with some of the newer stuff sounding somewhat sleepy by comparison.
