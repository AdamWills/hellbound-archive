Have a taste for gothic metal, science fiction and silent film? If so, you might want to check out the latest from Austria's **Darkwell**. The album, entitled _Moloch_, looks back to Fritz Lang's science fiction classic, _Metropolis_ (1927) for inspiration. An early taste of the new material arrived last August with the video for lead track "Yoshiwara."

Released in the fall of 2016, _Moloch_ arrives more than a decade after the last album from the band, _Metat\[r\]on_ (2004). Original vocalist Alexandra Pittracher has returned to the fold - the most obvious, but not only, sign of continuity between Darkwell's earlier recordings and what they're doing now.

Darkwell released a second video from _Moloch_ - the title track - this week. Story-wise, the band describes this song as a 'prequel' to "Yoshiwara," and again, the visual and thematic debt to _Metropolis_ is obvious.
