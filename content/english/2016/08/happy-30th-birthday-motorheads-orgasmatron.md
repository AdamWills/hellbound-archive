It seems almost impossible to believe, but thirty years ago on this date **Motorhead**'s **_Orgasmatron_** album was released on an unsuspecting public. It was the first album to see release after the band's 10th anniversary celebrations and was the first full-length to feature **Phil Campbell** and **Wurzel** on guitar, along with former Saxon drummer **Pete Gill** on drums.

The album was produced, somewhat controversially, by **Bill Laswell**. It is quite possibly the weirdest production ever heard on a Motorhead record, but with songs like "Deaf Forever", "Claw", "Dr. Rock" and the title track, _Orgasmatron_ is a bonafide classic and one worth celebrating. If you've never heard it, check it out below.
