Album number five from these Indiana stalwarts sees the band keeping with the cosmic themes of its predecessor, _Fate is Your Muse_. But this time, the lyrics seem more grounded in reality, including the Lemmy tribute track “Your Inner Lemmy” where **Devil to Pay** certainly channel one Mr. Kilmeister.

This record starts off on a faster note, with “On and On (In Your Mind)” showing signs of High on Fire and Mastodon. “Don’t Give Away the World” settles into a grungy groove, before “Kobold in the Breadbasket” takes things into even doomier territory, with a touch of Apostle of Solitude.

“Laughingstock” shows shades of The Obsessed, while “Recommended Daily Dosage” takes the riff from AC/DC’s “Dirty Deeds” and plays it in double time before slowing things down for a doomy chorus. And then again, there’s “Your Inner Lemmy,” which combines elements of a few classic Motorhead tracks to pay tribute to the man himself. Anthemic on its own, it also makes up one-tenth of a pretty solid album.
