It's a very metal week in Montreal. [Heavy Montreal 2016](http://www.heavymontreal.com) kicks off in Parc Jean-Drapeau tomorrow, complete with [afterparties](http://www.heavymontreal.com/heavy-in-the-city/) scheduled for Katacombes and L'Astral. And today marks the second day of Grimposium's [Doomed to Death](http://grimposium.com/doomed-to-death/) events - the reason I'm here.

Yesterday's [Grimposium](http://grimposium.com) activities covered a broad spectrum. [Vastum](https://vastum.bandcamp.com/)'s Daniel Butler presented a paper touching on neoliberalism, psychoanalysis, "obscure death" and death metal aesthetics, which led into a discussion guided by musician and criminologist Lee Mellor. Following the discussion, a rare screening of _Blekkmetal_ took the place of presentations from [Misery Index](http://themiseryindex.tumblr.com/)'s Mark Kloeppel and Jason Netherton, who were delayed in Germany and still en route.

(If you haven't read our [review of _Blekkmetal_](https://hellbound.ca/2016/06/blekkmetal/), check it out. Read Grimposium's press release for the day [here](http://grimposium.com/doomed-to-death-academic/).)

The evening's events took place around the corner at another Concordia University venue and covered even more ground. First we were treated to a fascinating bilingual workshop on death metal vocals presented by Marie-Hélène Landry ([Obsolete Mankind](https://obsoletemankind.bandcamp.com/releases)) and Sébastien Croteau ([Necrotic Mutation](https://www.facebook.com/necroticmutation/home)). Immediately following, the newly arrived Mark Kloeppel and Jason Netherton were joined onstage by  Michael Berberian ([Season of Mist](http://www.season-of-mist.com/)), Michelle Ayoub ([Broken Board Montreal](https://www.facebook.com/brokenboardmtl/home)), and Vivek Venkatesh (Grimposium) to sound off on the extreme metal scene.

Finally, a packed cinema experienced the Canadian premiere of [_Death by MetaL_](https://www.facebook.com/deathbymetalmovie/), Felipe Belalcazar's bio pic on the band Death and the man behind it, Chuck Schuldiner. A short Q&A afterward provided some additional insight into the filmmaking process and indicated a general appreciation for the film from its audience.

I'm not going into much detail here - my commentary and reviews are still to follow, including my coverage of [today's free panel](http://grimposium.com/doomed-to-death/) with Repulsion (US), interviewed by Albert Mudrian (Decibel) and Jason Netherton (Misery Index), and [tonight's concert](https://www.facebook.com/events/1614372642187115/) featuring Misery Index, Vastum, Vengeful and Cardinal Wyrm. Check either or both of these events out if you can.

In a small gesture of thanks to my Montreal hosts, I also encourage you to spend some time listening to [Dead Messenger](https://deadmessenger.bandcamp.com/). And, if you're in Toronto this weekend, check out [NO FUN, an interdisciplinary dance performance](https://www.facebook.com/events/1560535730908512/?active_tab=highlights) inspired by the music and movement of punk icon Iggy Pop. It's taking place at Factory Theatre Mainspace (125 Bathurst Street) till August 7.
