The fifth annual [**Calgary Metalfest**](https://calgarymetalfest.com/) takes place September 14-17, 2016, culminating in an arena show loaded with classic Canadian thrash. This might not be news to you â€“ tickets went on sale back in May. But as the countdown ticks on, you might be due for a welcome reminder.

A kick-off party gets things going at Calgary's Ship & Anchor on Wednesday, September 14. The Thursday show takes place at Distortion and features **The Exalted Piledriver**, making their first live appearance in Western Canada, with openers Crystal Mess, Savage Streets, Profits of Crime and Accostal.

Friday's gig, at Dickens, features headliners **Toxic Holocaust** along with **Disciples of Power**, The Order of Chaos, Fornication, Black Pestilence and Concrete Funeral.

And finally, on Saturday, September 17, **Annihilator**, **Exciter** (the original line-up), **Razor** and **Sacrifice** will perform at Flames Central, together for the first time on a Canadian stage (according to festival info).

Sounds too good to miss...
