Bit of an interesting back story behind this one. This Finnish death/doom outfit formed in 1990, and was signed to the legendary Black Mark Productions, where they put out a couple records in ’94 and ’95. _Garden of Shadows_, recorded in ’96, was to be **Scum**'s third album, but Quorthon reportedly tossed this demo in the trash (likely due to a distinct lack of frost and/or fire), the band broke up, and this music would remain unheard for the next 20 years.

And while _Garden of Shadows_ didn’t remain buried in my inbox quite that long, I’ll admit that I overlooked it several times before finally giving it a listen. Death/doom has always been hit-or-miss for me (Winter yay, Thergothon nay), and these guys weren’t particularly noteworthy, even in their day… but I hafta say, this record is a pretty decent listen, with equal servings of Tiamat, circa ’96, and Candlemass, circa ’06.

The album opens with “I Am Messiah,” which is _probably_ not an homage to Eddie Marcolin. However, this tune is sufficiently doomy, with a forlorn, longing intro leading into a pretty solid, six-minute, slow-motion stomp. Verses feature whispered vocals and sparse instrumentation before the chorus delivers death growls and downtuned, slowed-down death-metal riffs.

Some of the riffs and vocals on “Golden Seeds” remind me of Winter—I also hear a bit of Tiamat’s excellent _Wildhoney_ here. “Mountain of the Hawks” actually contains a couple riffs that wouldn’t sound outta place on an At the Gates or early In Flames record, although this is another slow one for the first couple minutes, with a knuckle-dragging tempo underpinning some doomy, downtrodden passages… and some really awful breakdowns beneath a plodding guitar solo. They even throw in female-sounding vocals for some reason just shy of the four-minute mark after picking up the pace.

We do get more of a melo-death influence in subsequent tracks, although the generally slow tempos keep the “doom” in the death-doom mixture. “Rise Like Morning Star,” with its “Whoa-oh” chorus chants might serve as a precursor to Amon Amarth, while the 10-minute epic “Trilogian Tales” is about 15 years ahead of Atlantean Kodex—except in the vocal department. Alas, this probably wouldda been a bit more cutting edge in ’96 than it sounds today… but it’s still a pretty decent listen.
