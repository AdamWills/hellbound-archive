Firstly, let me praise **Red Cain** for their commitment to music as a physical entity; the CD bears a most amazing cover by Peter Mohrbacher which would put many a major label band to shame. It just cries out to be released on vinyl so all its intricate details can be seen in all their glory.

Musically Red Cain are a modern melodic metal band, one that sounds very European to my ears, like Epica for instance.

Their musicianship is first class and the songs are well wrought epic melodic stories. In the space of four tracks Red Cain have more to say than most bands over a full album.

On the strength of this EP I’d certainly like to see a full-length album from Red Cain.
