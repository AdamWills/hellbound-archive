## Hellbound’s End of Year Wrap Up: Part 5

Well, hell’s bells – 2016 was a hellride of a year, wasn’t it?! As the New Year comes creeping in with trepidation, the individual members of Team Hellbound take a look back at our favourites of the year, give our personal thoughts on the state of heavy metal in 2016, and take a look forward at what’s to come.

As always, we here at Hellbound thank you all for your continued readership, and we wish you a very headbanging Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Happy Holidays from Hellbound!

ProgPower has always been an intriguing festival - a small-ish indoor fest that is happy to remain in its current successful form rather than grow to something bigger. This year's lineup, which included Haken, Blind Guardian, The Gentle Storm, Stream of Passion, Devin Townsend, and Green Carnation, was enough to get me down for the first time. Between the venue, the organizers, and of course, the performances (with Green Carnation's rendition of their Light of Day, Day of Darkness set taking the cake), ProgPower 2016 will remain with me for years to come.

 

**Most anticipated album for 2017:**

VUUR ([www.facebook.com/vuurband](https://www.facebook.com/vuurband/))

 

**Biggest Loss to Metal in 2016 (in memoriam):**

Aleah Liane Stanbridge (Trees of Eternity)
