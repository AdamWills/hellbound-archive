Sinistro is the second Portuguese outfit to hit my inbox in the past couple weeks, but they are two very different entities. Unlike Miss Lava, Sinistro is actually female-fronted, and their influences lean more heavily towards Neurosis than Kyuss.

They also seem to sing in their mother tongue, judging by the song titles. _Semente_, their second album, kicks off with the heavy, doomy downstrokes of “Partida,” which is pretty punishing right from the get-go. By contrast, the vocals are cooing, and almost soothing above this heavy riff barrage, though things do mellow out somewhat as they go along.

“Estrada” is mellower and more vocal-driven, although it’s still underpinned by some slow ‘n crunchy guitars. A very ISISy riff kicks in just past the three-minute mark. “Corpo Presente” keeps the same sinister guitar tones, while adding some orchestral instrumentation to the mix. Things get softer on subsequent tracks, with a loud/soft dynamic mixed into eight-minute epic “Reliquia.” In comparison, 11-minute album-closer “Fragmento” seems to drag on a bit too long, without AS much variation in tempo or intensity… but when the heavy riffs finally hit just shy of four minutes, they’re just as impactful as ever.
