Hellbound is happy to present "Winter," the latest track from _Early Signs Of Denial_, the debut studio album from modern heavy metal band **Black Absinthe**. The Toronto (ON, Canada) three-piece  was formed in 2011 by vocalist and guitarist Jack Cerre, bassist Kyle Scarlett and drummer Austin Henderson. They released their debut EP, _Augusta_, in 2012 and follow-up EP, _Noise Complaint_, in 2014. Last year the trio were headlining Toronto semi-finalists in the [Wacken Metal Battle Canada](http://www.metalbattle.ca/) 2015.

_Early Signs Of Denial_ – set for release on May 13, 2016 – was produced by Dave Baksh (Cross Dog, The Mahones) out of the Gentleman’s Den studio in Pickering, ON, and mixed and mastered by Frank Gryner (Rob Zombie - Hillbilly Deluxe). The title _Early Signs of Denial_ offers a conceptual connection to the themes of fear, corruption, and overcoming disparity explored throughout the album.

Vocalist/ guitarist Jack Cerre comments on "Winter":

"'Winter' is one of our favourite tracks to play live, and the experimentation during production surprised us! The song is about a family crossing the frozen St. Lawrence River during the settlement of Canada. There are French and English lyrics about a struggle against time and nature. While recording, the song exploded with harmony. (Producer) Dave Baksh and (guitarist) Jack worked out a lot of interesting guitar work, really just ear candy for true metal fans. It's an epic, so let the wind wash over you and take you to a cold dark place."
