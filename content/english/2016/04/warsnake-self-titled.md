Back in the day, I used to be AF Analog’s biggest fan. The short-lived local sludge band was never a household name outside their own households, but in '07/'08, they were the closest thing to Crowbar around this neck of the woods. Now a couple of those guys are in this new outfit, **Warsnake**, which slithers along similar lines. I’ve heard demos of most of these songs before, but am still looking forward to the finished product—which [you can totally download for free](http://warsnake.bandcamp.com/album/warsnake-2016)!

Warsnake comes crawling out of the gate with “This is War,” a slow Sabbathian start building up to a more mid-paced chug, with a couple Windsteiny breakdowns thrown in for good measure. “Low Life” starts off with a killer NOLA-style sludge riff, this one dealing in the same brand of low ‘n slow reefer madness as their previous outfit. “Second Hand Words” picks up the pace again, a frantic, two-minute march with a profane chorus. But “Organia” slows things back down; a wah-heavy, unholy roller.

They tend to switch gears quite a bit, displaying more of their hardcore roots by pushing the tempo to just shy of punk-rock fury on brief bursts such as “Lock the Gates” and “Spinning Wheels,” but sludge is a dish best served slow—and tunes like “Low Life” and the equally punishing “Night Sky” are near-perfect examples. Not sure if this is more than just a studio project at this point, but I could go for another helping.
