Starting the new year off right with a plethora of performances here, as the cold winter nights seem to only encourage Torontonians to rock out even harder.  Ranging from the irresistible blackened doom of Old Witch to relentlessly wild thrash of Brutal Wulfsex, and the hot ticket of Sleep with Montreal sweethearts Big Brave, there really is something for everyone this month.  Here's a rundown of what's going on this January.
