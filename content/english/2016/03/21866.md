#### “_when there is no more god, no more soul, no more hope,_

#### _there is the obscenity of flesh, the anguish of death, the darkness of despair._

#### _then it gets totally fucked up._

#### _this is the arrival of satan._”

While it may have taken Grenoble black metal outfit **The Arrival of Satan (TAOS)** six years to follow up _Vexing Verses_, an exceptionally deranged example of self-loathing _ad absurdum_ (‘Morbid Libido,’ for example, is a heartwarming ode to self-castration — SILLY LOVE SONGS FTW), the wait has proven worthwhile for us sick-but-patient fucks who get off on demonstratively transgressive art-metal (GUILTY!). _Passion Sodomy Terror_, their dopesick Osmose Productions debut (out now on digital/digipack CD/limited edition vinyl), erects bass-heavy walls of ultra-raw, hook-free tremolo-saturated blackness in a perverse ritual of hatred and nihilism. Fair warning, (un)true believers: this is not some treacly, feel-good soundtrack for Sunday brunching in Brooklyn _a la_ Deafheaven -- _Passion Sodomy Terror_ is the pus-seeping sonic equivalent of a flophouse Fentanyl overdose.

Driven by the demented vocals of Necropiss and atonal riffwork of Saint Vincent (Blacklodge, Vorkreist, ex-Merrimack), TAOS spew forth rough-hewed, jaundiced missives of vitriol throughout, leaving little room for the listener to breathe as noxious cuts like the post-punk varnished opener ‘Traitor Brigade’ and ‘Lolita in Furs’ overwhelm the listener’s senses. Barely contained claustrophobic extremity — sonic, conceptual, lyrical — takes complete priority over anything resembling conventional songcraft, much less hooks, which can make _Passion Sodomy Terror_ a harrowing listen, especially in one sitting.

That said, if you can muster the requisite endurance, you’ll find yourself taken on a strangely compelling, if outlandishly perverse, journey to the charred depths of the human psyche. Ultimately, TAOS have merely charted the cartography of the left hand path on _Passion Sodomy Terror_. Do what thou wilt with their disquieting, unrepentantly debased gospel of Gallic misanthropy.
