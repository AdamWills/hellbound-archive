**Dream Death**’s 1987 debut _Journey Into Mystery_ is one of the great lost metal classics of all time. On their debut album, this Pittsburgh outfit combined the nascent sub-genres of thrash and doom into a self-styled concoction called sludge metal—that’s right, they were the Possessed of all things tuned low and played slow.

Problem is, they never saw a cent from said record, released by some unscrupulous underground label back in the day. Since the band reunited for a 25th anniversary hometown show in 2012, they’ve self-released a long-awaited follow-up the following year, and have since become reacquainted with Rise Above Records, who had originally signed Penance, the trad-doom outfit formerly known as Dream Death, back in the day. Suffice to say, this band has substantial street cred.

After a brief, spoken-word intro, _Dissemination_ comes storming out of the gate on the title track, which perfectly captures the mid-paced chugging riffage and doomy downstrokes that had been the band’s calling card. The thrash-metal sneers of Brian Lawrence haven’t aged one bit, as he offers up a completely intelligible, old-school vocal vibe. The opening of “Expendable Blood Flow” sounds like Goblin meets “Iron Man,” ushering in another downtrodden doomster, with some slow-mo breakdowns somewhat akin to Crowbar. The creepy, horror-movie vibe is further accelerated by interlude “Crawling,” which features true-doom riffage beneath a rather impassioned spoken-word vocal.

“The Cold Hard Light” has a brief instrumental passage that nods to some of the jarring tempo changes on their debut, backed by a set of heavy-as-fuck, stop-start breakdowns. The chorus is more frantic, semi-slowed-down thrash, albeit with giant grooves befitting of the band’s self-imposed sludge moniker. “All in Vain” is a consistent mid-tempo slog along the lines of Slayer’s _South of Heaven_—especially in the vocal department. It picks up the pace right at the very end, leading us into the downright thrashtastic “Dominion,” which is much more aligned with _Reign in Blood_…until it takes an unexpected downtuned turn around the midway mark. Hey, there’s nothing wrong with a little Slayer worship, right? (I think these guys even opened for Slayer in the Steel City back in the day…)

Alas, while _Dissemination_ isn’t quite as seminal as Dream Death’s debut, it definitely gets the job done!
