Just caught this U.K. trio’s debut Toronto performance on the heels of Detroit’s Berserker Fest. Conan had been kicking around the British sludge scene for a few years before their breakout sophomore effort, 2014’s _Blood Eagle_ on Napalm Records, and now, striking while the iron is hot, _Revengeance_ comes out less than two years later. As you can expect from a band named after Conan, this is a barbaric, punishing effort, offsetting slow, heavy breakdowns with some jarring mid-tempo riffage.

“Throne of Fire” kicks off at a fairly brisk pace, with a downtuned, up-tempo attack akin to High on Fire, before dropping down to a knuckle-dragging crawler of a chorus. “Thunderhoof” is a much slower slog, nine-and-a-half minutes of bass-heavy bulldozing with shades of earlier Zoroaster and a bit of YOB thrown in for good measure. “Wrath Gauntlet” throws it down even lower and slower than its predecessors, a mighty instrumental rumble for nearly four minutes before turning towards a death march at the midway mark. The swirling guitar effects about five minutes in, along with the high-pitched vocals, once again bring YOB to mind.

The title track really picks up the pace with a barrage of black-metal drumming right from the get go before settling into a mid-paced hardcore stomp, easing off into some slo-mo breakdowns as they hit the backstretch. “Every Man is an Enemy” adopts a similar approach, another slow-to-mid-paced number reminiscent of YOB. Finally, the spacey, 12-minute epic “Earthenguard” brings this one to a close with some of the slowest, heaviest hitting riffs on the record. While the band’s influences here are obvious, it’s still a solid take on sludge metal.
