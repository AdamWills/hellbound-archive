_Wildfire_ is probably one of the best albums of 2016 so far. Having been nearly seven years since their last release, **Destroyer 666** are back and probably better than ever. When a band takes that much time off from writing, things can sometimes go south very quickly. But **D666** have proved that they are still true to the sound they have progressed on time and time again. This album has a very atmospheric and almost _cave-like_ production to it while still keeping that old school black/thrash element in check.

There isn't a dull track in the mix whatsoever. Every song rips and sounds like it was forged straight from the fires of hell. It it obvious when you listen to how solid every musician is that these guys put all the passion they have into their music. The dynamics and diversity within the album is what makes I so great. They know when to slow down and play softly, and they know when to annihilate every living thing on the planet.

At the end of the day **Destroyer 666** absolutely rule. There isn't anything negative I can say about _Wildfire_ in any way. It may end up becoming one of my favourite metal records of all time.
