Although sludge is usually seen as a southern staple, it also had a notable West Coast presence in its early years, with bands like Noothgrush outta Oakland and **16** from L.A., not LA. Like many early sludge outfits, 16’s discography is marked with a whole buncha splits and 7-inches, but _The Lifespan of a Moth_ now marks this outfit’s seventh album… four years after their last Relapse release, _[Deep Cuts from Dark Clouds](https://hellbound.ca/2012/04/16-deep-cuts-from-dark-clouds/)_.

This one opens somewhat deceptively with seagulls and children playing, but it’s not long before the band settles into a sludgy mid-paced groove à la Noothgrush or High on Fire. They slow things down a notch on pre-release single “Peaches, Cream and the Placenta,” a pretty solid Crowbaresque piece of downtuned doom, complete with Windstein-style windmill breakdowns. “The Morphinist” offers up another strong dose of heavy riffage, although this one is laced with a few more mellow passages.

“Gallows Humor” slows things down even further, a devastatingly heavy piece of sludgy doom that reminds me of YOB. “Pastor in a Coma” also contains traces of Scheidt-like heaviness, and some neck-breaking stop-start riffage, before “George” delivers the final blow, a slithering, stuttering sludge-metal slamfest. This is even better than their last record.
