This week on [Kill Eat Exploit the Weak](http://killeatexploittheweak.blogspot.ca/), Adam Wills and I had the pleasure of hosting local heroes / [Wacken Metal Battle Canada](http://www.metalbattle.ca/) winners **[Profaner](https://www.facebook.com/profanerofficial/)** as special guests on our (pre) Canada Day special.
