Just short of a year after the release of the critically acclaimed double album _Juggernaut:Alpha/Juggernaut:Omega_, **Periphery** return with a new full length album, _Select Difficulty_. With high expectations and much anticipation, fans can stop holding their breath, because _Select Difficulty_ is another high quality release from the Washington sextet.

_Select Difficulty_ is the natural progression from Periphery’s previous releases. To me this album is a condensed version of the twin _Juggernaut_s, basically an amalgamation of these two albums. _Select Difficulty_ goes 50/50 in terms of the sound the band achieved within the double album. Tracks like “Catch Fire” and “Marigold” take the more accessible route of _Alpha._ These songs feature liberal use of clean vocals and warmer instrumental tones. Contrary to this, “Habitual Line-Stepper” and the intro track “The Price is Wrong" veer towards _Omega_ territory. These tracks are much faster, very crunchy with the djent sound Periphery fans have come to know.

_Select Difficulty_ doesn’t feature the same level of experimentation present in the _Juggernaut_ tandem (it is only one album after all), but Periphery adds new elements to these tracks, and still provide that sweet, sweet technical riffage they’ve always been known for. Gone are 8-bit effects, elevator muzak, and in their place is heavy usage of orchestral instrumentation, dedicating much of the outro to the final track “Lune,” to classical stringed instruments, effectively transforming the tone established in albums prior. This is contrasted with droning Meshuggah_\-_like djent featured extensively on the heavier tracks like “Motormouth” with some improvisational flair that adds a nice flavour to the track. _Select Difficulty_ really is a beautiful blend of metal’s diverse sounds with the distinct style and sound Periphery has developed over the years.

_Select Difficulty_ is a growth point for Periphery musically. Gone is the heavy experimentation from the _Juggernaut_ tandem, and in its place come a much tighter and more strongly composed album, with an established style and timbre in _Select Difficulty_. The album is far less chaotic and dynamic in style than the _Juggernauts_ were. Aside from the contrasting heavy and poppy songs, _Select Difficulty_ ends up less surprising in the end. _Select Difficulty_ is still very nuanced and marks a moment in the history of Periphery where a clear identity seems to be surfacing. _Select Difficulty_ is the distillation of all that preceded it. It is a highly refined offering from a band who now know exactly who they are.
