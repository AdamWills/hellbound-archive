## Sunday night heavy metal on the Canada Day long weekend

This was my third metal show at [This Ain't Hollywood](http://www.thisainthollywood.ca/) in Hamilton this year. That the number isn't higher is my fault (I've missed some good local shows here and at other venues). But it's pretty sweet that I can rate the ones I have attended highly and declare my time and/or money well-spent.

### Lutharö

Each time I see [Lutharö](https://www.facebook.com/Lutharoband/) perform is better than the last. Their songwriting continues to mature and their already charismatic stage presence seems more and more like second nature. The band have a new guitar player who sounded like he'd been playing with them for ages. As always, I look forward to hearing what's to come next.

### Fog of Leprosy

Why did I think [Fog of Leprosy](https://www.facebook.com/Fog-of-leprosy-145746302148330/) was a doom band? They're not.

### Skull Fist

[Skull Fist](http://skullfist.bigcartel.com/) released [one of my favourite Canadian heavy metal albums of 2014](https://hellbound.ca/2015/01/best-2014-contributors-top-canadian-picks-individual-lists/) – _Chasing the Dream_. And I can't understand why they weren't on my top ten overall list, because I listen to that record more than half the albums I did pick. (Sorry, guys!)

Though I listen to Skull Fist repeatedly, I'm not good at keeping up on band news. So I had no idea frontman Zach Slaughter was semi-sidelined, or why, until we saw someone else fronting the band and Adam looked it up and told me Slaughter has had some trouble with his vocal chords. (Read up on [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/skullfisted/) if you want to know more.)

Fill-in Brian Stephenson is no replacement, but he did a great job with Skull Fist's material, in terms of spirit and delivery. I didn't expect to be dancing, but I was, and singing along, so clearly, I had a good time. The bluesy guitar solos were a great live touch, and each member made effective use of the small stage. The show felt intimate and larger-than-life all at once.

### Closing remarks

Hellbound wasn't officially covering this event – Adam and I went not for business but for pleasure. Still, the show was too good not to put down a few words documenting my appreciation, and to share the few cell phone photos I asked Adam to take.
