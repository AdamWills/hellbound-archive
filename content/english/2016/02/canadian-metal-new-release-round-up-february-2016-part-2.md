As I mentioned in the first of these posts, Adam Wills and I are always seeking out new Canadian metal releases to highlight on our CFMU\* show, _Kill Eat Exploit the Weak_. Today's entry is the third of the year, covering Canadian metal released between February 13 and today, February 26, 2016 (more or less). As always, please feel free to let us know about anything else that flew under our radar.

\*By the way, CFMU is about to kick off this year's fundraising drive, so if you're in the Hamilton area, or listen online, or just want to support campus-community radio, consider [showing your support with a pledge](http://cfmu.mcmaster.ca/app/promotions) or by spreading the word.

**Wake** _Sowing the Seeds of a Worthless Tomorrow_ (Sentient Ruin / Everyday Hate / 7 Degrees / Nerve) "... True, these twenty minutes are ingrained with H-bomb sized detonations of anger into each crusted, blackened moment. Within that time, though, Wake digs deep and dives through the bottom of the familiar grind formula to find some emotional grandness as well. ..." — _Read the rest of [Justin Allec's review here](https://hellbound.ca/2016/02/21847/)_.
