Here at Hellbound we get a great deal of satisfaction from promoting the Canadian metal releases we most appreciate, and one of the highlights of this ongoing coverage is our annual end-of-year Canadian metal feature. Which, disappointingly, didn't happen this year. We haven't yet mastered time travelling technology, so we can't go back and give it another shot, but we can take a little time and space to remind you of some Canadian music you should have listened to in 2015 and should listen to now, or, again.
