**Rhine** is one of metal’s best kept secrets… but not for much longer.

Rhine play progressive heavy metal in the best sense of the word. With some progressive metal bands, there is often an over emphasis on the progressive over the heavy or vice-versa, but Rhine have got the balance just right.

Drinking from the same wellspring of inspiration and innovation, _An Outsider_ is akin to Enslaved, Steven Wilson, or Opeth at their very best. As to its theme, in this isolated post-internet world… we are all outsiders now.

While progression and heaviness are always to the forefront, the music is always very emotional, sincere, and organic; it never fails to connect on an emotional level.

Finally, I have to say the songs are first class. They could be played acoustically and still carry the same emotional charge. No bigger compliment can I pay.

Get into Rhine now before they become huge.
