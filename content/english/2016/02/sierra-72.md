Really interesting backstory to this record. Kitchener trio **Sierra** has put out a 22-minute, one-song concept album about a murder that happened in their backyard in the early 70’s, and the dude who was wrongfully accused. (Turns out he’s one of their bros, or something.)

_72_ starts off with some slow-rolling stoner grooves, setting a lighter tone initially before a wave of guitars comes crashing in briefly. From there, we get a sparse, guitar-driven passage that leads to some killer instro breakdowns. There are brief flourishes of some 70’s style rock here, before moving on to some stripped-down, acoustic guitar passages as the first vocal comes in on a jazzy note. We get a heavy-hitting bridge with hints of Neurosis and System of a Down, before it’s back to another mellow verse with jazzy bass accents. One forlorn passage has hints of what sounds like a music-box melody, adding a Goblinesque feel to the proceedings. Another mellow interlude has shades of “Spirit Caravan.” And it ends on a big, operatic, arena-rock chorus a la Dream Theater that’ll have you reaching for those lighters.

In spite of the year it’s named after, this record sounds more like a 90’s vintage, a cross between grunge, alternative and stoner rock. And as far as murder-inspired opuses go, it’s no _Sinister Slaughter_ or _Thy Kingdom Scum_. But still, it’s not a bad effort.
