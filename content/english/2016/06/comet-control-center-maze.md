This is the second release from Toronto psych rock outfit **Comet Control**, following their self-titled debut in 2014. A couple of these guys have some history with Tee Pee stalwarts Quest for Fire, although I found their new outfit to be a little more structured and poppy than its predecessor. Before I give that one another spin, I gotta say, what’s with the American spelling of centre, eh?

Anyhoo, this second effort offers up 45 minutes of psychedelic bliss. “Dig Out Your Head” is equal parts jangly pop and Middle-Eastern trippy, with a nice, crunchy backbeat beneath Chad Ross’ soaring vocals. “Darkness Moves” has a few smooth Earthless grooves, though it’s a fairly compact three-and-a-half-minute number, not a swirling psychedelic jamfest. There are certainly some shades of QFF on this one, as well.

“Silver Spade” gets even janglier, a shimmery psych-pop number a la Brian Jonestown Massacre. There’s some nice swirly instrumentation toward the end that adds a wall-of-sound feeling to the proceedings. “The Hive” sorta sounds like Tom Petty on acid, while “Criminal Mystic” reminds me more of Blue Oyster Cult, and eight-minute epic “Sick in Space” screams Pink Floyd. They’ve certainly got that 70’s sound down pat, though it falls somewhat shy of _heavy_ psych.

(Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but this is a heavy-metal site, so, y’know…)
