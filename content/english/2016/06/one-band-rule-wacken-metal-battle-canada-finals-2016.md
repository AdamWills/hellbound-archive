The final round of this year's [Wacken Metal Battle Canada](http://www.metalbattle.ca/index.html) competition takes place at Toronto's Opera House this Saturday, June 11. Whichever band emerges victorious will be the fourth Canadian metal artist to represent our nation on the international Metal Battle stage at Wacken Open Air in Germany – a competition that's been running for more than a decade.

Several weeks ago Sean Palmerston and I had the pleasure of judging, along with Ross Ingall of [Metal Nation Radio](https://www.facebook.com/MetalNationRadio/), the first ever Hamilton round of the contest. Hamilton winners **Profaner** went on to win one of two semi-final rounds held in Toronto and will now be crossing axes with competitors from across the country: **Tales Of The Tomb** (Edmonton, AB), **Pyramid Theorem** (Toronto, ON), **The Mountain Man** (Vancouver, BC) and **Distorthead** (Montreal, QC).

The combatants will be joined by guest headliners **Crimson Shadows** who have the distinction of winning the inaugural Wacken Metal Battle Canada in 2013 and then going on to victory at Wacken Open Air that year as well.
