British imprint HeviSike Records leaves little to the imagination—you get a sense of what kinda music this is before you even push play. And sure enough, the debut album from London power trio **Bright Curse** is equal parts heavy and psychedelic, capturing that retro-rock feel of Kadavar or Graveyard.

“Lady Freedom” is led by a heavy, distorted guitar riff, though it’s not all ground-n-pound, with a few mellow passages thrown in for good measure. The singer, who’s originally from France, has a Euro accent somewhere between Klaus Meine and the guy from Witchcraft, which only adds to the continental feel.

“The Shore” has a very Graveyard vibe, sounding like one of the mellower tracks from their latest record, albeit not without a super-heavy chorus. “Cheating Pain” has a similar song structure, with a lighter, sparse verse culminating in a hard-hitting refrain. Suffice to say, this band wears its influence on its sleeve, as the haunting “Walking in a Graveyard (Bloody Witch)” would illustrate.

Let’s face it, this is Graveyard/Witchcraft worship done right… They don’t tread any new ground, but the familiar sounds are well played.
