The splendidly named **Mars Red Sky** have produced a really good album. I would sum it up as a cross between Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd ( I was reminded of the spacey dynamics of "Astronomy Domine," for instance), Hawkwind (particularly Lemmy-era Hawkwind such as _Warrior on the Edge of Time_), Voivod (there is the same musicality and spirit of adventure), and especially Kyuss circa _Welcome To Sky Valley_ (my favourite Kyuss album, and their most adventurous).

_Apex III_ strikes just the right balance between musical virtuosity and song-writing, and is, as all good music should be, a pleasure to listen to.
