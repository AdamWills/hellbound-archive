Every once in a blue moon, I get an album to review that truly is a pleasant surprise. Such an album is **A Rebel Few**’s _As The Crow Flies_. Coming across as a killer modern combination of Down and Lynyrd Skynyrd, this is one seriously good album.

A lot of things make_As The Crow Flies_ special: the band’s obvious chops and chemistry, the superb warm production courtesy of Sterling Winfield – but overall, it’s the songs. This is an album of truly great songs.

This is a band singing about real things, the kind of things that matter to folk on a daily basis, and I think A Rebel Few could, and indeed should, be huge.

Seriously, a band destined for greatness, and you can say you were there at the beginning!
