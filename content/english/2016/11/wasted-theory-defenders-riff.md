The heaviest damn band outta Bear, Delaware is back with its second record, with a nod to Judas Priest and an album cover that screams High on Fire. These guys pull no punches off the bat with “Get Loud or Get Fucked,” a solid southern-rock stomper. This song actually reminds me of the late, great, Toronto southern doomsters Diablo Red—which is definitely a good thing in my books!

“Atomic Bikiniwax” pokes fun at one of Meteor City’s finest, with a solid mid-paced attack that could probably hold its own in New Jersey, albeit with a much gruffer vocal than Ed Mundell and company. “AmpliFIRE!” is a significantly slower sludge number, with some great head-nodding grooves, bringing Borracho to mind. “Belly Fulla Whiskey” kicks off with someone cracking a cold one, though it’s a little more mellow, sounding sorta like something by King Giant.

This record gets better as it rolls along. “Under the Hoof” also screams Diablo, with a hella-catchy chorus, to boot! “… and the Devil Makes Three” is a mish-mash of Clutch and Motorhead, with another lighter-raising refrain. “Throttlecock” is a pretty decent sludgy punk ‘n roller that recalls Matt Pike and company, before “Odyssey of the Electric Warlock” takes things out on a doomier note. Don’t be fooled by the silly song titles—they ain’t messin’ around, son!
