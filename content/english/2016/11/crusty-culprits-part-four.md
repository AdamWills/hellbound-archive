Welcome to **Crusty Culprits #4**, where I shine a light on some rough fvckin’ diamonds from the world of D-beat, crust, hardcore, and all punk rock points in between. In recent years, Bandcamp has proven to be a goldmine for finding pick-sliding punks, so that’s where Crusty Culprits’ pool of provocateurs is drawn from. Thanks a bunch for reading, and keep an eye out for more Crusty Culprits features in the near future.

## More crust from Bandcamp, continued

### Okus – _Scourge_

(Distro-y Records)

Irish label Distro-y Records has a bunch of great punk bands on the books, and fellow Irish marauders Okus are one the label’s best. If you’re a fan of heavyweight crossover crust—i.e. classic bands like Sacrilege, Hellbastard or Amebix—then you’re going to love Okus’ _Scourge_ album. There’s a mountain of ye olde pulverizing crust to enjoy here, and pile of misanthropic doom to wallow in too. Add a ton of grinding, nihilistic noise into the mix, and then clad everything in a blackened suit of armour, and that’s Okus’ plan of attack. The band smash galloping D-beats into full-throttle blast beats while howling at the world. It’s an ugly and bruising noise. And highly recommended.

### Dödläge – _Ritual Slaughter_

(Profane Existence)

Portland, Oregon’s Dödläge is a heavyweight champ when it comes to tone, temper and technique. The band’s first full-length, _Ritual Slaughter_, is easily one of this year’s best crust punk LPs, and it follows on from a 2015 self-titled 7-inch from Dödläge that was pretty goddamn killer too. In terms of its sheer sonic strength, _Ritual Slaughter_ ranks amongst the hardest hitting releases that the long-running collective Profane Existence has ever released. Dödläge’s red-raw crust is certainly indebted to weapons-grade Swedish kångpunk, and as the band tears into their songs with unstoppable savagery the echo of Totalitär and their Scandi kin rings loud. However, there’s also a hefty amount of titanium-tipped hardcore and grindcore to be heard here too. So Dödläge are very adept at attacking on all fronts. No question, _Ritual Slaughter_ is a nihilistic knockout.

### Warthog – S/T 7-inch EP

(Beach Impediment Records, Static Shock Records)

The latest ferocious 7-inch from New York punks Warthog is the band’s best yet. That’s no easy feat, considering Warthog’s two previous 7-inch releases (on labels Katorga Works and Iron Lung Records) delivered first-rate and iron-clad roughneck punk. Warthog don’t waste a second on their new 7-inch as they set to tearing reality apart at warp speed again with four feedback-fuelled tracks that are covered head-to-toe in barbwire. Expect ear-splitting riffs and strident vocals, but most of all one _in-fvcking-tense_ shockwave. A couple of reviews have called Warthog’s latest 7-inch an instant NYHC classic. That’s very hard to dispute.

### Vaaska – _Futuro Primitivo_ 7-inch

(Beach Impediment Records, Vox Populi )

Vaaska’s last full-length, 2015’s formidable _Todos Contra Todos_, was one of my absolute favourite releases last year. The Austin-based band’s second album was stacked to the gunnels with amp-melting D-beat, vitriolic vocals howling Spanish lyrics, and incendiary solos firing off in all directions. The band’s _Futuro Primitivo_ 7-inch continues along those exact same lines; no need to change a 100% successful and 1000% ferocious formula, amigos. There’s crust-coated guitars cleaving left, right and centre on _Futuro Primitivo_, and a rhythm section charging like a herd of rabid rhinos. If you’re seeking jagged-edged and breakneck punk that hits like a ton of bricks, rest assured that _Futuro Primitivo_ happily provides an utter hammering.

### Crown Court – _Capital Offence_

(Katorga Works)

’Ere we go, more bovver boy Oi! From Crown Court, London Town’s finest boots-and-braces street punks. The band’s _Capital Offence_ LP was one of this year’s most anticipated punk albums, and man, it was totally worth the wait. Crown Court had built a significant following off the back of their _Trouble From London_ demo and two subsequent and widely acclaimed EPs, so the pressure on the band to deliver with _Capital Offence_ must have been fierce. No problem there, though, because _Capital Offence_ is stacked with sing-along anthems that are hugely enjoyable and rowdy and riotous to boot. The album harks back to the working-class roots and swaggering hooks of Oi!’s earliest years, and _Capital Offence_ is duly loaded with gritty and street-wise hooks. A classic debut, fo’ sure.

### Pure Disgust – S/T

(Katorga Works)

Crown Court’s first full-length wasn’t the only highly anticipated debut from label Katorga Works this year. Also of note is the incendiary self-titled debut from Washington DC’s Pure Disgust. Like Crown Court, Pure Disgust built a solid reputation with a rock-solid demo, a bunch of promo tapes, and a couple of firebrand EPs, and the band’s first full-length has been long-awaited. Never more timely, _Pure Disgust_ tackles the causes and effects of racism, poverty, incarceration and all manner of socio-political problems head-on. With ten rapid-speed tracks spread out over 18 whirlwind minutes, Pure Disgust rips into society’s ills with a sound that’s grounded in ultra-aggressive DCHC but incorporates jagged shards of street punk on the album. Rightly incensed, Pure Disgust are a crucial voice in punk rock in 2016. The band’s debut is an even more crucial statement of the times.

### [???? (Paranoid)](http://pndftw.bandcamp.com/) – _Punkdemonium Hell_/_Nightmare Or Reality_/_Satyagraha_

(Viral Age Records, Southern Lord, D-Takt & Råpunk Records)

Here’s a trio of releases that aren’t exactly new, but they’re all well worth talking about nonetheless. ???? (aka Paranoid) are a Swedish hardcore band heavily influenced by raw Japanese punk groups like Disclose, D-Clone or Gloom. It’s not all Nippon-inspired noise for ???? though. The band throw a heap of “Venom-styled black metal” into their “vortex of head-banging chaos and pure D-beat fury”. Paranoid’s volatile first full-length, 2015’s _Satyagraha_, was re-released by label Southern Lord this year, and it (very) deservedly found a whole new audience in the process. Don’t skip on the band’s _Punkdemonium Hell_ or _Nightmare Or Reality_ releases though. The former is a three-track neck-wrecking triumph. The latter is a covers tribute to Japan’s aforementioned punk icons Disclose. All of Paranoid’s releases are white-knuckle thrill rides. Get ’em, now.

### Kohti Tuhoa – _Rutiinin Orja_

(Svart Records, Southern Lord)

Let’s throw one more Southern Lord reissue into the mix before I go. Finnish band [Kohti Tuhoa](http://kohtituhoa.bandcamp.com/)’s rip-roaring debut, _Rutiinin Orja_, was originally released by the seemingly always on-point Svart Records back in 2015. (Actually, Svart released another storming album from fellow Finns Terveet Kädet in 2015, and you should check out their _Lapin helvetti_ album out. It was/is a fvcking riot.) Southern Lord picked _Rutiinin Orja_ up for wider release in 2016, and the album’s jam-packed with ear-bleeding D-beat and warp-speed hardcore. All the vocals are delivered in Finnish, but that’s really no issue if you don’t speak the language. [Kohti Tuhoa](http://kohtituhoa.bandcamp.com/)’s über-intense singer, Helena, delivers every line with manic fury and gusto that’ll raise your fist in the air anyway. _Rutiinin Orja_ is fuelled by chaos and rage, and it’s supremely addictive too. Gold star filthy noise.
