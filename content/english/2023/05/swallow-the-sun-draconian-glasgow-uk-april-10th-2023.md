What better way to celebrate Easter Sunday than a gloom-drenched evening with Nordic doom metallers Swallow the Sun and Draconian? This funerary co-headlining tour stops in Glasgow’s Slay on its UK tour. The venue is busy, defying both economic despair and festive familial commitments.

Sweden’s **Draconian** are a well-established hybridisation of gothic and death/doom metal, in mourning since 1994. Last year was particularly special for the Swedes; their original female singer _Lisa Johansson_ rejoined the band following the departure of Heike Langhans, concluding a decade-long absence. The goth metallers take the stage and being a sextet, they truly occupy the compact stage. Their show begins with _The Sacrificial Flame_, from their latest full-length _Beneath a Godless Veil_. The guitars are quiet in the mix and succumb to the drums and robust vocals of _Anders Jacobsson_ and _Johansson_. _Johnasson_ is in her element performing Langhans’ material and imbues her performance with abundant sincerity. 

Plenty of the setlist originates from _Beneath a Godless Veil_, including _Lustrous Heart_, _The Sethian_ and _Sorrow of Sofia_. _Johansson_ is faithful to Langhan’s voice, offering a melancholic counterbalance to _Jacobsson’s_ bruising growls. Icy rain-swept guitar leads are backed by clouds of distortion to craft haunting and solemn songs. **Draconian** are masters of the typical oscillation between light and dark themes that goth and death/doom acts play with. The band’s stage presence is energetic, given their sparse space to move. _Seasons Apart_, _Elysian Night_ and _Dishearten_ make hairs stand on end. Still, their performance's highlight is rightfully saved until the end - _Daylight Misery_ from their highly acclaimed album _Arcane Rain Fell_. This was an enigmatic performance that could bring tears to your eyes.

Finland’s **Swallow the Sun** are one of the melodic metal bands that came of age in the early 2000s and deservedly rose to stratospheric heights. Their sun-deprived doom metal twist on the genre provided ample atmosphere and solitary introspection. Beginning with _Enemy_ from their most recent album _Moonflowers_, the quartet blanket Slay with thunderous riffs and piercing guitar leads from axemen [_Juha R_](https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Juha_Raivio/574)_aivi_[_o_](https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Juha_Raivio/574) and _Juho Räihä_. The sound is flawless, complimenting the dark, sinister passages and crushing drums. 

Wearing hoods, the line-up strikes quite a brooding presence on stage, headbanging through a sombre set. _Moonflowers_ is promoted keenly with dirges including _Keep Your Heart Safe from Mine_, _This House Has No Home_ and _Woven into Sorrow._ On record, this album features violins, violas and cellos to embolden their music with classical takes on first-hand grief. These instruments are absent live, and admittedly it does strip away some atmosphere, but these tracks remain entertaining in their own right. Other discography highlights, such as _Falling World_, _Firelights_ and _New Moon, receive resounding responses_. Vocalist _Mikko Kotamäki_ gets a chuckle from the crowd when he announces that the rest of the set will feature no more clean vocals, just focusing on his monstrous death metal growls. The last song of the night is the beloved _Swallow (Horror, Part 1)_. The venue rewards this sublime show with rapturous applause. The set has elapsed its scheduled run time, and thankfully, _Swallow the Sun_ aren’t forced to truncate their set. 

This co-headliner of complementary but differing bands was a solidly satisfying slab of melodic doom. Both of these acts prove that depressive metal can be entertaining live and is the furthest away from a snooze fest.
