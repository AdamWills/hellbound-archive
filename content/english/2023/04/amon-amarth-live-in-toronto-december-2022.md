The Great Heathen Tour saw Viking metal legends [Amon Amarth](https://hellbound.ca/?s=amon+amarth) joined by death metal giants [Carcass](https://carcass.bandcamp.com/), [Obituary](https://www.obituary.cc/) and [Cattle Decapitation](https://www.cattledecapitation.com/) for a North American tour of epic proportions.

Belatedly, here are some captures of the tour's stop in Toronto at the east-end venue History, by guest photographer Keith Ibbitson of Lower Eastside Photography.  Follow Keith on Instagram : @metal\_paparazzi\_66
