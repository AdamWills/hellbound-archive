Canadian Technical Death Metallers _Archspire_ are bringing their Tech Trek Europe Tour to Glasgow. It's been just over three years since these madmen were last in the city and the Cathouse is rammed with eager attendees. 

France's _**Benighted**_ hit the stage with a grindcore-flecked death metal attack. Song structures bristle with infinite brutality and an abundance of varied arrangements and tempos that keep the songs fresh. In 2020, the four-piece released their ninth album _Obscene Repressed_, which receives solid promotion tonight with the likes of _The Starving Beast_ and _Brutus_. The band's inventory includes earthquake-inducing blastbeats, blisteringly scathing guitars and psychotic growls, enough to satisfy the most demanding headbangers. Combined with a spirited stage presence, **_Benighted_** are an unbridled force of live death metal. 

Tech death can often become meaningless riff salad, with songs indistinguishable from each other. Australia's _**Psycroptic**_ evades this description. _David Hayley_'s guitar efforts are more melodic compared to most tech death acts, which makes imprints their tracks in the listener's head. Vocalist _Jason Peppiatt_ is absent and usual replacement vocalist _Jason Keyser_ from **_Origin_** is behind the mic on this tour. The quartet's appearance exclusively focuses on the latter end of their discography, including last year's _Divine Council_ album. The likes of _A Fool's Errand_, _(Ob)servan_t and _The Water of All_ whip up the crowd into a mosh pit that perplexedly transforms into a conga line. _Keyser_ is a worthy replacement for Peppiatt and finds it effortless to motivate the crowd into moshing more enthusiastically. Intricate riffs and rigorous drumming keeps eyes on the stage, delivering a highly skilled death metal exhibition.

Finally, headliners _**Archspire**_ kick off proceedings with _Remote Tumour Seeker_. The sheer fury and energy of these Canadians is nothing short of mesmerising. With crazed time signatures, breakneck tempos and a clinical approach to savagery, it feels like the band is composed of machines. Even _**Oliver Rae Aleron**_'s growls feel technical; he delivers them at a pace quicker than an organic tongue can waggle. Guitarist _Dean Lamb_ and _Tobi Morelli_ craft songs with catchy hooks, crushing rhythms and thoughtful melodies. _Jared Smith_'s bass plays a key role in **_Archspire_** and certainly isn't relegated to the back as bassist frequently are.

Tonight's setlist is exclusively selected from their last two full-lengths, _Bleed the Future_ and _Relentless Mutation_. _Abandon the Linear_, _Human Murmuration_, _Calamus Will Animate_ and _Involuntary_ _Doppelgänger_ deservedly receive rapturous responses from the fans. Like their music, their live show discerns itself from a generic gig. _Aleron_ is armed with a bubble gun that he shoots at the crowd. Mosh pits are mandatory for the entire set, but proceedings turn left when _Aleron_ throws a Twister mat to the crowd for a game that shfits into another pit. Amazingly, he retrieves it in one piece too. _Drone Corpse Operator_ gives the Cathouse one final opportunity to go wild. The performance flies by and it feels too soon for **_Archspire_** to leave, but time just transpired that rapidly. Technical musicians are often criticised for putting on boring performances where they just stare at their instruments. _**Archspire**_ prove that tech doesn't have to be tepid with their amusing showcase.
