Another [Bandcamp Friday](https://isitbandcampfriday.com/) has arrived! This one really crept up, and there's been no shortage of awesome releases.

As with last month's edition, to keep things from getting too overwhelming, your friendly overcaffeinated contributor, Danielle, is here to list albums that have already been released as of today.  There are also a bunch of pre-orders that are really getting my goat but I'll save those for next month when they're out.

The crushing header image from THEY GRIEVE features artwork by Pascale Arpin.

To keep up with all of my random musings, getting way too excited about first listens and eyeballing the finest merch on an almost daily basis, you can follow along on Instagram ([@riffsdontlie](https://www.instagram.com/riffsdontlie/)).  Alright, here we go, better have those headphones ready if your neighbours/family/roommates don't like it loud because all of these are going to make you want to crank up the volume:
