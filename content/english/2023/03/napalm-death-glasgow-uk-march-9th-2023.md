Grindcore legends _**Napalm Death**_ return to Glasgow with the Campaign for Musical Destruction 2023 tour. Just in December, these crazed Englishmen in Glasgow opened the eclectic bill of **_Volbeat_** and _**Skindred**_ at the Hydro arena. Now, they’re rightfully headlining the Classic Grand and the show is sold out. Like many, this gig fell victim to the pandemic and was postponed for just over a year. 

Unfortunately, the delay isn’t the only misfortune afflicted on this show. Bassist _Shane Embury_ can’t make the tour, so Pro-Pain bassist _Matt Sheridan_ substitutes for him. Two nights before, vocalist _Barney Greenway_ injured his ankle. He comes out to greet the venue supported by crutches and takes a seat in the centre of the stage for the entire duration of the concert. Those familiar with _**Napalm Death**_ live also know that long-term guitarist _Mitch Harris_ doesn’t play live, so _John Cooke f_rom _**Venomous Concept**_ and **_Corrupt Moral Altar_** picks up the axe in his place.

Despite these alterations, these gentlemen grinders waste no time igniting dynamite with opener _Narcissus_ from last year’s _Resentment is Always Seismic - A Final Throw of Throes_ EP. Maybe it’s _Greenway_ sitting in a chair, the lack of familiarity with this newer song or the need to warm up, but the crowd’s reaction is oddly subdued. There’s no moshing or crowd surfers. However, all hell breaks loose for the next song _Backlash Just Because_ with an enormous pit detonating in the front and centre of the venue with no shortage of moshers surging through the crowd to get to it. 

This song and the following two - _Fuck the Factoid_ and _Contaigon_ - are from **_Napalm Death_**’s last full-length release _Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism_. Their 16th studio album is a creative inclusion of dreary slightly slower atmospherics with the usual tornado death-grind menace the band has perfected in their latter years. Being behind the eternal moshers and crowdsurfers makes it nearly impossible to glimpse _Greenway_ or drummer _Danny Herrera._ _Cooke_ and _Sheridan_ capture most of the audience’s attention and fortunately, their stage presence is suitably emphatically energetic. _Greenway’_s barks are as battering as they usually are live but the lack of his idiosyncratic hyperactive presence really detracts from the show.

Along with the new fare, the band unwrap some of their most popular anthems. Older signature material like _Suffer the Children_ (preceded by Greenway commanding anti-abortionists to fuck themselves), _Scum, You Suffer, The Kill,_ as well as modern classics including _Smash a Single Digit_ and _Everyday Pox_ brutalise the venue. Always keen to pay homage to their influences, _**Napalm Death**_ fire out their grisly grinding takes on _**Bad Brain**_’s _Don’t Need It_ and the mandatory cover of _**Dead Kennedy’s**_ _Nazi Punks Fuck Off_. Despite its murky and chaotic nature, the sound at the Classic Grand is sublime, making it imperative to headbang to these songs.

After _Nazi Punks Fuck Off,_ _Greenway_ announces that the next song is the final one. He apologises for being _a twat in a chair_ tonight but at least they didn’t cancel; when life gives you lemons, you grind. The final number is the catch grind classic _Siege of Power,_ unleashing an explosive audience response. Short but sweet, this concludes a vicious hour of a limited yet enjoyable version of _**Napalm Death.**_ Hopefully, they return to Scotland as quickly as last time, all in tip-top shape.
