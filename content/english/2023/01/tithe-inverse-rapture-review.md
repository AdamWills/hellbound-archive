On February 17th , Tithe will release their 2 nd album after _Penance_ (2020) titled _Inverse Rapture;_ and released in conspiracy with _Profound Lore Records_.

Hailing from Portland, Oregon, _Tithe_ are a trio consisting of Kevin Swartz, Matt Eiseman and Alex Huddleston. They play a hybrid of Death/Doom and Grindcore that’s fast, heavy and unrelenting. I_nverse_ _Rapture_, compared to _Penance,_ is similar in execution albeit, much faster, heavier and gruesome than their previous efforts. The wall of sound they create is surely enough to level the stage in live performances. This album will certainly please the fans of _Lord Mantis_(US) and _Minors_(CA) in their similar execution of vocals and melody.

While listening to this album, you’ll lose track of time when listening and it’ll be over before you know it. _Inverse Rapture_ is a perfect workout album in its speed and tone. While it is unrelenting, heavy and fast, it doesn’t really strike as anything I would personally be able to listen to over and over. An album like this certainly is a welcome addition to the _Profound Lore_ roster and is well paired with some dumbbell skullcrushers. If there would be one sentence to sum this album up it would be this: _Inverse Rapture_ is exactly what you expect it to be, fast, ruthless and pummeling for a kickass 30 minutes that flies by.
