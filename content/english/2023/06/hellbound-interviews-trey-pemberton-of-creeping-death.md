Trey Pemberton (of Texas death metal band Creeping Death) chats from his porch with us.

Watch below to hear about why he thought Toronto was the "rowdiest" stop on their recent tour, and what it's like to tour with Carcass.Â  We also asked about his picks for the best Texas death metal bands and got a whole playlists' worth!

Creeping Death embarks on a two-part tour on the release day of their new album "Boundless Domain" - June 16, 2023.
