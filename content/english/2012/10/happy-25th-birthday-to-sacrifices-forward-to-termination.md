Today, October 12th, is the 25th anniversary of the release of **_Forward to Termination_**, the sophomore album by Scarborough ON thrash metal quartet **Sacrifice**! Originally released on this date in 1987 through Diabolic Force/Fringe (and later on in the USA through Metal Blade and Europe through RoadRacer), the album contains the band's big Much Music video hit "Reanimation", which was played a shitload back in the day. It was in regular rotation! Much Music actually played videos back then! Here it is:

As some of you may know, I do have a professional relationship with the band now so I am not going to go into this album from a critical standpoint, but if you like great eighties thrash metal and have never heard this one then I suggest going out and getting a copy of it come hell or high water. Here's a few more youtube clips to check out too:
