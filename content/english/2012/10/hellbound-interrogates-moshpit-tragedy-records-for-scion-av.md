**By Sean Palmerston**

Earlier this year I was contacted by **Scion AV** to see if I would be interested in doing an interview for them with a Canadian label. The label in question, **[Moshpit Tragedy Records](http://moshpittragedy.com/)**, is a Windsor, Ontario based label that works almost entirely on a "pay what you want" business plan. The label gained noteriety early on by releasing digital versions of Amebix albums and has continued releasing digital versions of bands such as **Nausea, Extreme Noise Terror** and **Skarp**, as well as selling digital downloads to music from **Relapse Records** and **Feral Ward**.

It was a long rainy day when I drove up to Kitchener and then got in the van with the great film crew from **[Blue Lizard Productions](https://www.facebook.com/BlueLizardProductions)** that was shooting it all for another three hours down to Windsor. Here is the final product of the day's work, whittled down to about 10 minutes worth of interview clips. Thanks to **Rayny Forster** for being cool while I asked him question after question:
