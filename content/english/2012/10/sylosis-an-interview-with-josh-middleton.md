**By Jason Wellwood**

**Sylosis** have just unleashed their latest masterpiece _Monolith_ through Nuclear Blast on October 5th. On this, their third album, the band has taken their blend of progressive thrash and moved things forward. While still a complete ‘shred fest’, _Monolith_ has more feel to it, more ambience if you will. Taking the band to record where giants have tread before (Monnow Valley Studio, which has housed Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Rush to name a few) seems to have given **Sylosis** the ability to convey mood a little more, and dial back on the technicality of their songs. _Monolith_ is a fantastic achievement for this young band, and I had the pleasure of speaking with founding member/guitarist/vocalist Josh Middleton a few days after the North American release of the album.

The audio of the interview is below, and if you’d like to hear more, as well as the full album, tune in to Blowing Up The Lakehead, Monday October 22nd at 11pm Eastern ([http://www.luradio.ca](http://www.luradio.ca)) or if you can’t catch that, check out the Witchfinder Blog later on in the week for the playlist and links to download the podcast version of the show.
