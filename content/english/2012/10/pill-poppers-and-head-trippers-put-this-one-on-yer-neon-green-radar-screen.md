[As I've previously remarked](http://www.hellbound.ca/2012/01/well-it-aint-the-el-mocambo-but-its-the-next-door-thing/), The 460 might not be El Mocambo, but it's the next-door thing.  This evening, the hole-in-the-skywall bar is hosting a couple instrumental psychedelic-rock outfits that'll expand yer mind--and they're both from right here in yer backyard!  (Well hey, Ottawa's only about a four-hour drive, right?)

Hailing from the nation's capital, [Monobrow](http://www.facebook.com/monobrowmanband) brings the doom, filtered through a hazy 70's jam-band lens.  Had a chance to catch these guys on their home turf at the All That's Heavy II gig, and they were quite spectacular.

[Galaxies in the River](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Galaxies-in-the-River/154406324624880) (GITR) is one of my favourite local bands going.  These guys giv'r with some old-school, acid-flashback, Son-of-Hendrix freakouts, leading you down the twisted path into drug-fueled enlightenment -- or something like that.

[Ol' Time Moonshine](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ol-Time-Moonshine/138584019513076) includes half of my all-time favourite Toronto band, Diablo Red.  The good half...

And I've never heard of the opening band, but I'm sure they're good, too.

**Monobrow, Galaxies in the...  Fuck it, all the info's in the poster above.**

Peace,

Greg
