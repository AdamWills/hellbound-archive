If stoner doom legends Sleep have never played Toronto, it's not due to any sort of security issues.  In fact, two-thirds of the original Sonic Titans will be in town within the next eight days.  I can say [I saw Sleep's only Canadian date](http://www.hellbound.ca/2011/07/just-got-back-from-calgary-and-boy-is-my-wallet-tired/)\--in Calgary, no less--last year, but it doesn't appear that they're touring again anytime soon.  In the meantime...

- Tomorrow night, OM is at The Great Hall (Queen & Dovercourt) with support from Daniel Higgs (ex-Lungfish) and local legends Sons of OTIS.  Al Cisneros has moved away from the doom since swapping out drummers, but the man remains a stellar bassist.  That said, I'd imagine the focus will be on their last two albums...
- High on Fire plays The Opera House next Monday (November 26th) with support from Goatwhore, Lo-Pan and Primate.  Matt Pike and co continue to crank out their menacing mix of sludge/thrash, which should appeal to fans of both the slow and the fast shit.
- Of course, Chris Hakius retired from music a few years back, and as such Jason Roeder of Neurosis fame has sat behind the kit for the marijuanauts on their occasional excursions since.  That said, Neurosis is playing a big album release party tonight with YOB and Voivod--in Oakland, California.  They'll be heading off to the UK at the end of the month for a couple gigs, but there are no East Coast concerts confirmed in the interim.  Bummer!

On a (somewhat) related note, I've been counting down the top 10 doom duos [on Gruesome Views](http://gruesomeviews.com/tag/doom-duos/) for the past view days.  Of course, OM figures to be on that list somewhere...

**OM, Daniel Higgs, Sons of OTIS, Wyrd Visions @ The Great Hall, 1087 Queen St W., Sunday, November 18th.  Doors @ 8.  $15.50.  19+.**

**High on Fire, Goatwhore, Primate, Lo-Pan @ The Opera House, 735 Queen St E., Monday, November 26th.  Doors @ 7.  $21.50.  19+.**

**Sleep @ Your Dreams, 666 Weed St, Date TBA.** ;)

Peace,

Greg
