**[Ancient](http://www.facebook.com/ANCIENTRIFFS)s** is a band we have covered before on the site, so when they asked us to present this show we were in. Also playing with them at this show are some of the best local Vancouver metal bands, including **[Burning Ghats](https://www.facebook.com/burningghats)**, **[Nylythia](https://www.facebook.com/hyperthrashmetal)**, **[Cathar](https://www.facebook.com/cathargrind)** and **[Graves](https://www.facebook.com/cathargrind)**. A few of the Hellbound staff should also be in attendance - it's gonna be a killer night of metal!
