Y'know, whenever I've seen Maiden at the ACC in the spring or the fall, I've always been able to get floors, but I've had no such luck at the Molson Ampitheatre.  I was up on the Live Nation website as soon as the clock struck 10 this morning, and as a result of my efforts, I'm stuck up in Section 302, Row L--and it's still costing me more than I ever paid for floors indoors!  ($16.75 convenience charge!?  Fuck you!)

Yes, I'm aware that the pit at the Ampitheatre is a lot smaller than the ACC hockey rink.  I was also aware of the Live Nation pre-sale yesterday, but unable to access it at work.  By the time I got home, the best pre-sale seats available were pretty much the worst seats in the house, so I passed on the hopes that I could do better when tickets became available to the general public.  Which I did.  In fact, I think I'm closer to centre stage than I was last time, though I don't remember what row I was in--and I can't seem to find that ticket stub.  Hmm.

Of course, all the good seats don't sell out in a matter of seconds.  For the past few years, Maiden has been offering "First To The Barrier" access to its fanclub members, a privilege that'll set you back [30 British pounds annually](http://www.ironmaiden.com/fan-club-purchase.html) if you live in North America.  I guess that also comes with a magazine, some pictures, a merch discount and such.  But meh, I haven't been a big fan of any album they've put out since _Brave New World_, though I believe I've bought all its successors.  (I really need to stop doing that!)  I know I could do without receiving glossy photos of those old geezers every quarter, but hey...

...I suppose I can also do without seeing them from the floor the fourth time around.  I've never really been much of a mosher, anyways.

Peace,

Greg
