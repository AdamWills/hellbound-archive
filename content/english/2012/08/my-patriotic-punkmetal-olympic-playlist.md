Well, unlike Vancouver 2010, I can't truly say that I'm sick of our national anthem by now--Canada's only won one gold medal this time around.  But that said, while watching some exciting Olympic action, I still prefer to have the following blasting in the background...

[**Dayglo Abortions - Proud to be a Canadian**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-1D27HeX50)

Nothing fills me with Canadian pride like this two-minute punk song from Victoria's Dayglo Abortions.  Although, sometimes to mix things up, I put on the [Fuck the Facts version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgoXPiYQGb4) with the _Strange Brew_ samples instead...

**PATRIOTIC PROSE:** "Our prime minister sucks dogshit through his nose/His ex-wife gets brown showers from Mick Jagger"

...

[**Subhumans - Oh Canaduh**](http://music.cbc.ca/play/artist/The-Subhumans/Oh-Canaduh)

The perfect soundtrack to another fourth place finish or bronze-medal match loss.  Oh Canada--what's wrong with you!?

**PATRIOTIC PROSE:** "You spent all your money on a lot of useless toys/You’re so fucking dumb you stupid cowboys"

...

**[Mononc' Serge et Anonymus - Mourir pour le Canada](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc5B_9Wu1kY)**

With most of Canada's medals coming from Quebecois athletes in the first week of the Games, I had to find something in _la langue de Parizeau_ that reflected the desire to go to war and die for Canada.  Wait, you mean Mononc' Serge is a separatist and this song is satirical!?  Oh shit...

**PATRIOTIC PROSE:** "Comme le castor vaillant qui construit son barrage/ou l’orignal parlant couramment deux langages/me monte à la gorge un sanglot de joie/tant je veux mourir pour le Canada!"

...

**[Helix - Rock You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BNnu3Ip9gE)**

Best.  Canadian.  Jock Jam.  Evar!!!!!

**PATRIOTIC PROSE:** "Gimme an R..."

...

Peace,

Greg
