Hey folks! Long time no post! It’s been a ridiculously busy summer in radio/OIMA/father land for me so I’m way behind on posts and reviews. I’ve cut way back on shows and am hoping to have a whole whack of stuff for you to read (and perhaps listen to) in the coming weeks. Starting today though, I thought I would post the playlists for the main radio shows that I still do (Blowing Up The Lakehead \[Monday 11pm-2am\] and CanKnuckle Tracks \[Tuesday 10pm-1am\]). You can find out more at [www.facebook.com/witchfinderradio](http://www.facebook.com/witchfinderradio) and you can listen at [www.luradio.ca](http://luradio.ca) . We’re podcasting (sort of) now as well, so if you want to look for older shows, or if you miss these ones and want to hear them I will be posting links to the .MP3 files at the Facebook page the day after each show. If I miss one and you want it, let me know! _witchfinderradio@luradio.ca_
