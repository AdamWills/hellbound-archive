I've been living and attending concerts in Toronto for over seven years now, so it's safe to say I've seen a few local bands who got big well before they were known commodities.  A few names come to mind like Blood Ceremony, Cauldron, Diemonds, Anvil--hey, they weren't really that well-known till that movie came out!  But now, I can even say I've seen a band from Hamilton go from the Toronto scene to the national stage.  That band just happens to be called Monster Truck.

I remember the first time I saw these guys at the Bovine.  It was NXNE, no CMW, no I think it was NXNE 2010, if I'm not mistaken.  I was trying to figure out what bands I should check out on a Thursday night, and I happened to see that Monster Truck was playing the Bovine.  And that was all the information that was out there, really; there was no description of the band on the NXNE website, and as I recall, they were simply filed under Rock.  But the name alone was awesome enough for me to seek 'em out on Myspace (LOL), and I immediately liked what I heard; retrofied, southern-fried classic rock grooves with soulful singing and Hammond organ.  Yeah, might as well check these guys out...

For a while there, it seemed the Truck played the Bovine every couple weeks or so, and while I wasn't at every one of their shows, I did catch 'em a few times.  The following year, at CMW (I'm pretty sure it was CMW this time), they even played Lee's Palace--but they went on at 1 am and the place was mostly empty.  Still didn't stop them from putting on a solid show, though.

Anyways, I'm not quite sure what happened in the interim--they still only have a couple EPs out, which I downloaded from their site quite some time ago--but the last time I saw Monster Truck, they were opening for [Deep Purple at Massey Hall](http://gruesomeviews.com/2012/02/13/well-i-guess-those-old-guys-still-got-it-sort-of-anyways-deep-purple-massey-hall-february-12th/).  I guess they've toured across the country a couple times, and even opened for Slash in the States.  Not only that, but they're a pretty big name locally, too.  They'll be back at Lee's in a couple weeks, but the gig's already sold out in advance.  Wait, drop that apostrophe.  The gigs are sold out in advance--two of them-- Friday _and_ Saturday nites!  (I guess they're sponsored by The Edge or something...)

In any case, to go from playing Lee's Palace at 1 am in front of maybe 50 people to doing a two night stand there for 850 less than two years later is a pretty meteoric rise.  And hey, I'm happy for them.  I'd much rather hear that kinda rock on the Canadian charts than fuckin' Japandroids or something.  The downside is that while I live less than two blocks from Lee's, I still wasn't able to get a ticket in time.  Oh well.  I'll probably see them next year--opening for Rush, maybe?

If you somehow still haven't heard of Monster Truck, you can [check 'em out here](http://ilovemonstertruck.com/wordpress/?page_id=56).

Peace,

Greg
