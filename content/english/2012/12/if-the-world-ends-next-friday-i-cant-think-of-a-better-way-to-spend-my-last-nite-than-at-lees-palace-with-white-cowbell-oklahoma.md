For the past few years, White Cowbell Oklahoma's Christmas show has always been an event I've marked on my calendar.  Toronto's most outrageous, over-the-top live band usually has something special up their sleeves around this time of year, and this year is no exception.  Mind you, they've scheduled things a week later this time to coincide with... the end of the world!

Okay, so I don't actually think the world will end on December 21, 2012 any more than I thought it would on January 1, 2000.  But I don't doubt that the band will have some fun with that whole idea.  Their shows tend to be pretty lively, with a whole cast of characters aside from the regular band members, who are quite colourful themselves.  For instance, as [I wrote three years ago](http://www.hellbound.ca/2009/12/too-much-cowbell-is-never-a-bad-thing/): The MC for the evening was Colonel Sanders, or rather a guy who spent a lotta time putting together a Colonel Sanders costume.  When somebody yelled “Fuck you and your chicken!” he responded by saying “Well, in prison we used to do some stuff…  But don’t you talk that way about my chicken!”  He was joined on stage by a Bible-burning Southern preacher, Ebenezer Scrooge, Hank the Hanukkah Hot Dog (erm, yeah…) and a Santa Claus with a sizeable shooting penis that would make Oderus Urungus jealous.

Past installments have also featured a guitar/bass solo showdown between the brown guy in Sum 41 and the brown guy in Billy Talent, a certain former member playing slide guitar with his, erm, member, the fiddler from the opening band serenading us with "Love is River" completely buck naked--and of course, the traditional chainsaw slaughtering of several stuffed animals.  It's pretty much the most fun you can have with your boots on!

**White Cowbell Oklahoma End of the World X-Mess X-Plosion with guests The Manvils and Taratuela @ Lee's Palace, Friday, December 21st.  Doors @ 9.  $15 (advance).**

Peace,

Greg
