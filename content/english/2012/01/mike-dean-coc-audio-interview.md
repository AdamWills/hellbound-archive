On Thursday I had a chance to speak to Mike Dean of the recently reunited **Corrosion of Conformity** about their excellent upcoming self-titled album that will be released on Candlelight Records. We had a nice chat while he walked his dogs, chatting about making the new album, how the band got together again as a trio and about being a metal musician for thirty years. He didn't even diss me when I accidentally said the name of their last album wrong! Here is that interview in its entirety.
