Late last year **Jason Wellwood** had the chance to speak to the one and only **John Arch**, the original vocalist for US progressive metal legends **Fates Warning** about his recent _Sympathetic Resonance_ collaborative album with FW guitarist **Jim Matheos** under the name **Arch/Matheos**. Here is their chat, originally broadcast on Jason's radio program Witchfinder Radio on CILU in Thunder Bay, Ontario, in its entirety.
