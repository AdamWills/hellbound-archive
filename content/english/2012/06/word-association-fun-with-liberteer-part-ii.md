**By Kevin Stewart-Panko**

Yup. No fucking regrets. After my proclamation earlier this year that **Liberteer**'s debut album, _Better to Die on Your Feet Than Live on Your Knees_ is the front runner for my favourite album of the year, I'm standing by those words 150-fucking-percent. And yes, I still say that even after fucking Palmerston took like four months to run this second part of this interview! I've been spinning the album a few times daily since last week and am loving it more and more each time. So, I got in touch with main man (well, only man) behind Liberteer's all-awesome awesomeness, **Matthew Widener**, for another round of word association. Here's the resulting silliness.

**1776** Can we have a redo? **1984** Ghostbusters in theater, library ghost, shit my pants.

**2012** Light the fucking fuse already. **666** Appended to half my passwords, ha.

**The Iron Lady** In hell with Regan? **Iron Chef** Not a foodie but love procedural shows.

**Iron Butterfly** Turn the radio dial. **Unions** Inside capitalism, just another hierarchy.

**Obama** Worth voting in 2008 just to see it happen; back to not voting in 2012. **Osama** Hate's extremist endgame.

**Super Bowl** Oh, that's why there's no traffic! **Middle class** Unsustainable.

**Mandolin** Easy guitar, let's be honest. **Flag** Tribalism. Terror Management Theory.

**Space Travel** Humankind's greatest proclamation of freedom in the face of absurdity. Also kind of pointless. Still, feel like a wide-eyed 9-year-old. **Whiskey** Take out the "e" and make mine a single malt from Islay. Bury me with an Ardbeg.

**Cuba** Domino theory. **Coffee** Three a day slave.

**Resistance** Ghandi. **Explosions** Less fire than in the movies, scary in a different way.

**High heels** Can be art, but mostly just hobbling. **Combat boots** Can find comfortable ones, but mostly just hobbling.

**This interviewâ€¦** Surprisingly fun.

Better to Die on Your Feet Than Live on Your Knees _is out now on Relapse Records. Buy it already, will ya!_
