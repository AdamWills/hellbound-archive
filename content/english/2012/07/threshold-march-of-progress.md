**By Raymond Westland**

I’ve always had a soft spot for UK-based prog outfit **Threshold**. They’re not the flashiest band around, but they always deliver. In my (humble) opinion albums like _Critical Mass_ (2002), _Subsurface_ (2004) and _Dead Reckoning_ (2007) can easily hold their own against anything Porcupine Tree, Opeth and Dream Theater put out recently. Treshold’s latest musical venture, entitled _March Of Progress_, was a couple of years in the making and it shapes up to be the band’s longest record yet.

_March Of Progress_ also marks the return of singer **Damian Wilson**. That’s about the biggest chance compared to the previous Threshold records. This album pretty much picks up where _Subsurface_ and _Dead Reckoning_ left off. The emphasis is still squarely on songwriting finesse and any technical prowess is mainly used to cement the overall song material. _March Of Progress_ is most of all a moody album. It reflects on all today’s comforts and the complacency that comes with it. This is especially the case on “Return Of The Thought Police”, “Colophon” and “Staring At The Sun”.

_March Of Progress_ has all the hallmarks of a high quality Threshold album. The songwriting is impeccable, **Karl Groom**’s guitar solos are as tasteful as ever and Damian Wilson really poured his heart into the album, but for some reason this album misses the boisterous joie de vivre of _Subsurface_ and _Dead Reckoning_. Tracks like “Ashes”, “The Hours” and the aforementioned “Staring At The Sun” and “Return To The Thought Police” are great songs in their own right, but they miss the energy and the sense of urgency of “Phenomenon”, “Fragmentation”, “Mission Profile” or “Slipstream”. Perhaps this has something to do with the tragic passing of former singer Andrew McDermott or because the album is simply a bit too long for it own good.

As ever Karl Groom and Richard West did a splendid job in the sound department. They gave _March Of Progress_ a clean and polished production, but it still heavy enough to give the song material that extra punch.

_March Of Progress_ has much to offer and it’s a solid Threshold album by any standard. However, for me it simply lacks the punch and the energy of _Critical Mass, Subsurface_ and _Dead Reckoning_. A little more spice wouldn’t hurt on the next Threshold album.
