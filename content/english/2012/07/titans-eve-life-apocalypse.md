**By Matt Hinch**

Following hot on the heels of their 2011 release, _The Divine Equal_, Vancouver's **Titans Eve** released their new album _Life Apocalypse_ on July 13,2012. Continuing with the concept album theme, _Life Apocalypse_ centers around the challenges people face in their lives and surviving to tell the story. The backdrop for these tales is based on a modern thrash blueprint. Drummer **Casey Ory**'s fleet feet propel the album along its path with all the speed and dexterity you would expect from thrash. That is not to say Titans Eve can be directly compared to any of the Big 4. While certainly drawing stylistic influence from that scene, _Life Apocalypse_ does not present itself as derivative. While not breaking down barriers, Titans Eve have carved their name in the concrete with a sound this writer feels sets them apart.

Guitarist/lead vocalist **Brian Gamblin**'s singing has a seasoned quality to it. An experienced feel that makes the listener believe the reality of the album's themes. Almost like the hardships that permeate the lyrics are filtered through his voice. In keeping with the old school influence, guitarist/backing vocalist **Kyle Gamblin** trades leads with his brother on a number of tracks to a highly effective degree. We're not talking Maiden/Priest duel leads but these guys can certainly shred. Rounded out by bassist **Jesse Hord**, this quartet blasts through the album's 11 tracks with considerable conviction. The band's admirable technicality and familiarity makes the listener feel comfortable. This in turn leads to a feeling of acceptance and accessibility. The listener is free to enjoy the album without feeling too challenged.

I generally find instrumentals in the middle of an album can sap the energy being built but given the reflective nature of **Life Apocalypse**, “A Wound That Never Heals” serves as more of a break to process the trials overcome on the tracks preceded it and as a preparation for those to follow. It's welcome and soothing rather than useless filler. _Life Apocalypse_ sticks to the point. Not as terse as grind by a long shot, however the album never overstays its welcome with only one song topping the five minute mark.

What Titans Eve has managed to do with an album based on hardship is inject an air of triumph into their catchy delivery. The uplifting nature that saturates the album brings hope that no matter what we face in our lives, all our life apocalypses, the strength to rise above them is within us all.
