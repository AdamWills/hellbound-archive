**By Raymond Westland** **Paradise Lost** is one of the true pioneers of the early UK doom/death metal movement, together with Cathedral, My Dying Bride and Anathema. As with many long serving bands they had their bit of success and adversity. However, nowadays Holmes and co are perfectly happy in their own niche, releasing a string of outstanding albums in the process. _Tragic Idol_, their latest offering, is arguably the best of the lot..

**Nick Holmes** and his merry men aren’t trying to reinvent the wheel on _Tragic Idol_, as they did on _Host_. No, they opted to take the best elements from their landmark albums _Icon_ (1993) and _Draconian Times_ (1995) and combine those with the heaviness and songwriting prowess of _In Requiem_ (2007) and _Faith Divides Us – Death Unites Us_ (2009). This makes _Tragic Idol_ a record that should appeal to both new and old PL fans alike.

**Greg Mackintosh**'s trademark weeping and meandering guitar leads and solos are back in full force. This gives tracks like “Crucify”, “Honesty In Death” and “In This We Dwell” that classic _Icon/Draconian Times_ charm. Former At The Gates/Cradle Of Filth skinsman **Adrian Erlandsson** confines himself by providing a solid back beat, but it’s on the drum-driven “Worth Fighting For” where he really shines. Nick Holmes’ anguished vocals are in fine form and he really manages to bring “Fear Of Impending Hell”, “Honesty In Death” and “The Glorious End” to life. The incredible level of songwriting and maturity makes _Tragic Idol_ a truly stunning album.

The previous album sounded a little too compressed for my personal liking, however this issue has been addressed on _Tragic Idol_. This time around Jens Bogren (Opeth, Ihsahn, Borknagar) chose for a more guitar driven and spacious production. A smart move, because it really underscores the grandeur of _Tragic Idol_.

Holmes and Co have come full circle on _Tragic Idol_, because it harnesses the best elements from the classic _Icon/Draconian_ Times period with the songwriting prowess and maturity of modern day Paradise Lost. This album is certainly one of the highlights of this year. Highly recommended!
