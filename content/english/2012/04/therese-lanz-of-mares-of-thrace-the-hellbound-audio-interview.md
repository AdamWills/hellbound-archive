Hellbound regulars should definitely be familiar with **Mares of Thrace** at this point. If not, you can read Kyle’s review of the latest album here: [http://www.hellbound.ca/2012/04/mares-of-thrace-the-pilgrimage/](http://www.hellbound.ca/2012/04/mares-of-thrace-the-pilgrimage/) . I had the opportunity to chat with **Thérèse Lanz** about Mexican food, video games, being interviewed, stupid questions she is asked, Chicago (and what to eat late night), U.S. Politics and a little bit about music a few weeks prior to the release of _The Pilgrimage_ (Sonic Unyon Metal) and the cross Canada tour that will probably be bringing Mares of Thrace close to your town. Regardless of how many times you speak to Thérèse, she is always entertaining and has a lot of very informed things to say on pretty much any topic. But mostly on tacos and video games...
