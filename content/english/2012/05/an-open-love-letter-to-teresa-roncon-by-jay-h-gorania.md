**By Jay H. Gorania**

Dear **Teresa Roncon**,

I don’t know your current relationship status, so if you are taken, please do not be offended by this love letter. I mean everything I’m about to say with all due respect. I’m writing you in hopes that you are single. If that’s the case, I would like to be your man, or take you out on a date at the very least.

Don’t worry. I’m not a stalker type. Actually, if this doesn’t sound too pompous, I think I’m quite charming. I’m tall, dark and handsome. My nephews always laugh at my jokes, so I think it’s safe to assume I’m funny. And I’m an educated man. Academically, yes, but what I mean by that is that I’m a student of life. I’m a student of the Earth and the universe, and I truly believe that learning is a life-long process. I suppose I might not be the most humble guy out there. LOL

Anyway, I was blown away by your beauty as well as your pleasant and cool attitude when I saw you hosting the Power Hour/Power 30 on MuchMusic in the early ’90s. I would of course have seen the show regardless of your involvement, since I’m a lifelong metal fanatic, but seeing your gorgeous face at the onset of the episodes put a smile on my face every time. More often than not, I taped the shows rather than racing home from high school to catch them, since I was habitually at the gym immediately following my classes. Yes, I do work out.

I do want to bring up the fact that I was at a party once and I had no choice but to defend your honor. You see, some drunk guy had the audacity to call you something I won’t repeat here, and I had no problem with lunging toward him, demanding that he recant his offensive statements. Fortunately, numerous people got between us and we were separated. He did apologize, however. And I didn’t care about everyone getting on my case about “overreacting.”

Sure, at times I might be hard on the outside, but truthfully, I’m a pretty sensitive guy. I have a really big heart. What else can I say about myself?

I love my family and friends. I love to travel. I love spending time on beaches. I enjoy long walks. I can’t live without staring at the stars and the Moon. I really appreciate the simple pleasure in life, too. A nice egg breakfast, for example.

Well, I’d rather not waste too much of your time by rambling now, so I’d just like to say that I think you’re great, and I have no idea where you live now, but if you’re single, I’d love to take you out on a date some time. I promise that you won’t regret it! ;)

Sincerely,

Jay H. Gorania
