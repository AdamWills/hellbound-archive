On Wednesday, February 8th the current **Gigantour** festival made a stop at Hamilton, ON's Copps Coliseum. This was the first time that all four bands **(Lacuna Coil, Volbeat, Motorhead** and **Megadeth**) ever played here in "the Hammer", which was super convenient for me as the arena is about three blocks from my work and less than six from my house. So, when an offer was made to do an interview with someone from Megadeth how could I possibly say no?

**Chris Broderick** has been one of my favourite American guitarists for over a decade now. After being introduced to his guitar playing through **Jag Panzer** I have been following his career and have enjoyed seeing him perform with Panzer, **Nevermore** and Megadeth. I took this interview opportunity as a chance to ask him about the current Megadeth album _TH1RT3EN_, about his new Jackson signature guitar, the guitar camp/clinic he recently hosted along with **Alex Skolnick** and the recent break up of Jag Panzer.
