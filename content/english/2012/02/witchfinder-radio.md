This week, I thought I’d do some horn tooting and let you know what is coming up on [Witchfinder Radio](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Witchfinder-Radio/184368678252247) over the next little while. Tonight (if I get this up in time) on Blowing Up The Lakehead (10pm-1am EST) we’ll have an interview with Mike Dean and full album feature on the new [Corrosion of Conformity](http://coc.com) record. The interview will appear here in text form within the next few days but for now, if you’re interested check it out on the air. Next week we’ll have Joe Hoare on the show along with the new [Orange Goblin](http://www.orange-goblin.com/) record ‘A Eulogy for The Damned’. Both albums were released on [Candlelight Records](http://candlelightrecordsusa.com/site/) which seems a little unlikely but the albums are excellent and the promotion for both has been stellar so far. Good work Candlelight team! Next week will also feature [Gideon Smith of Gideon Smith and the Dixie Damned](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gideon-Smith/156407677779456?sk=wall) and the full 30 Weight album. Seems the majority of interviews in the next little while are going to be airing on Blowing Up The Lakehead, but I do have a few things lined up (potentially) with [Aggressor](https://www.facebook.com/aggressivemusic), Nephelium, [Derelict](https://www.facebook.com/DerelictMetal), [Waster](https://www.facebook.com/WASTERofficial) and [The Great Sabatini](https://www.facebook.com/thegreatsabatini) for CanKnuckle Tracks (Tuesday’s 10pm-1am EST) in the next little while.

Not sure when some of these are going to air, but I also have interviews with Ralf Sheepers of [Primal Fear](http://www.primalfear.de/), Casey Orr from [Ministry](https://www.facebook.com/Ministry)/[Rigor Mortis](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rigor-Mortis/291446746851) and Ben Varon of [Amoral](http://amoralweb.com/) in the can. I’d like to split them up to keep from doing too many all interview shows but they keep coming! In the works for this week interview wise are both [Axel Rudi Pell](http://www.axel-rudi-pell.de/index1.html) and [Nephelium](https://www.facebook.com/nephelium).

Plenty of interesting stories to hear, and plenty of metal to listen to! Tune in to [Witchfinder Radio](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Witchfinder-Radio/184368678252247), part of [LU Radio, 102.7fm](http://www.luradio.ca) in Thunder Bay Monday & Tuesday 10pm-1am, Wednesday (punk night) from Midnight-1am and Thursday Midnight to 1am.
