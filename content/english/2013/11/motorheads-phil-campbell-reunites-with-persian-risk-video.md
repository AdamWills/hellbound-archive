Just thought I would mention this cool new video that has shown up on YouTube: earlier this month **Motorhead** guitarist **Phil Campbell** was back in his native Wales playing with his pre-Motorhead NWOBHM outfit **[PERSIAN RISK](http://www.persianrisk.co.uk/Persian_Risk/Home.html)**. He left the bad when he joined up with Lemmy and co back in 1984, so this is a tread to see him do a couple of their classic tunes, plus a cover of "Ace of Spades" in a small bar called Bogiez in Cardiff, Wales back on November 10th, 2013.

Check out the video below:
