Canadian progressive metal outfit **Protest The Hero** is one of the many bands lately that used crowdfunding in order to bankroll their latest album. _Volition_ is a deliberate return to the band’s earlier works, so let’s see how it pans out.

_Scurrilous_, the band’s previous record, is a fine release in its own right. However, it lacks the charm and energy of some of Protest The Hero’s earlier works. This pesky little issue is solved with _Volition_. The band’s trademark technicality in combination with their impeccable sense for songwriting makes a glorious return on tracks like "Clarity," "A Life Embossed" and "Drumhead Trial." Singer **Rody Walker** is in fine form and guitarists **Luke Hoskin** and **Tim Millar** adorn the album with tasteful guitar licks and memorable riffs.

As with the previous albums the devil is in the details. What sets Protest The Hero apart from their peers is their meticulous attention for small details. Many tracks on the album have small acoustic interludes and other nifty elements, which form a nice contrast with the heavier guitar parts. Lamb Of God’s **Chris Adler** provided the drum parts on _Volition_ and he does an admirable job. He really underscores his position as one of the premier drummers in metal today.

_Volition_ is the album the band should have made after _Kezia_ (2005) and _Fortress_ (2008). The perfect blend of songwriting and technicality makes this record a true standout. This baby is a prime candidate for my best of the year list.
