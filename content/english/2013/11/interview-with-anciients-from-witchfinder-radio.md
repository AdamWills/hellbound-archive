So, last night on [Witchfinder Radio](http://www.facebook.com/witchfinderradio) I aired my interview with the fellas from [Anciients](http://www.facebook.com/ANCIIENTSRIFFS) that I had recorded the day after their tour had ended and just a few days after the tour with Sepultura had been scrubbed due to visas not being obtained in time for Septultura. The band was hanging out in the Season of Mist offices, and were all in great spirits. It was a blast to finally chat with a band that I had been following for a few years and put some voices to the names. If you haven't checked out their amazing album Heart of Oak, do yourself a favour and pick it up! It will easily make my top 10 of the year.

I've put the complete interview below, and you can download the show with the audio at: [http://luradio-server.lakeheadu.ca/2013/Witchfinder%20Radio/](http://luradio-server.lakeheadu.ca/2013/Witchfinder%20Radio/) for about a month. The files you need to download are marked WR Nov18-1 (through 6). If you want to check it out and it's not there any longer, you can email me at: witchfinderradio@luradio.ca
