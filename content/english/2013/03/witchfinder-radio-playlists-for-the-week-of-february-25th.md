Well, I've been away from the site for a bit…sorry! I know you've all been missing me! Fund Drive 2013 for the radio station kicked off this week and I've been super busy getting set up. My radio shows are going to be doing some giveaway incentives over the next couple of weeks so please: tune in and help support independent radio in Thunder Bay! You can also check out our indiegogo campaign at: [www.indiegogo.com/luradio](http://www.indiegogo.com/luradio) You’ll see updates soon, including a new column this week as well. In the meantime, here are last week’s playlists. This week’s will be up on Wednesday!
