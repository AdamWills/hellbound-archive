**By Matt Hinch**

Salt Lake City’s **Subrosa** established themselves on 2011’s _No Help For The Mighty Ones_. That album garnered the band considerable praise, and rightly so. Incredible tone, two electric violins and gorgeous vocal harmonies set the band apart. It was certainly unlike anything this writer has heard before or since. Until that is, _No Help_’s worthy successor _More Constant Than The Gods_ found its way to the critics.

Subrosa continue using the formula that has worked so well for them. That being in large part dynamics, textures and layers fed by pure emotion. For six tracks spanning over an hour we are privy to more shifts in tone, volume and sensation than one can take in without committing oneself to absorbing all that Subrosa lays out. Fourteen minute opener “The Usher” is a perfect example of this. Male and female vocals weave around each other as the violins lead into the crushing might the band is so good at. Thunderous and doomed guitar and bass collide with the dual violins and fall together in dynamic grace. These, along with the drums and a trio of harmonizing vocals fit together like pieces of a puzzle creating a vista of forlorn beauty. The album’s namesake lyric is contained herein as part of an incredible passage of expression. It’s as heartbreaking as it is uplifting.

_You’re more constant than the stars Because they change their paths with the seasons You’re more constant than the moon Because she hides her face in the shadows You’re more constant than the sun Because one day her embrace with melt the earth You’re more constant that the gods Because sometimes when we call, they don’t answer at all_

From “The Usher”

Much of _More Constant_ is vocally/lyrically driven as referenced on the immediate and sinister, yet sad and desolate “Ghost of a Dead Empire” and the beatific journey that is “Fat of the Ram”. Single “Cosey Mo” sees the emotional core of the song transformed from devastating to delicate by the violins as well as the vocals. The track rises high upon the flames as the chant of “Burning!” injects a fire into the listener. Violins caress with melody and varying warmth as the song winds down with doomed grace.

Heaviness and atmosphere are at play on “Affliction”. Tectonic riffs rattle the listener with seismic might and the violins dance among the cracks left in the aftermath. Slow and doomy, with anguished vocals, the track moves with a bevy of emotional textures leading the way.

Closing track “No Safe Harbor” saves the most heartbreaking sorrow for last. Piano and flute wrench every ounce of sadness from the listener’s soul. As usual, love is the center of the lyrical content. Stirring vocals harmonize with tearful impact before the tone changes again, as one would expect. The track and album close out with harrowing beauty, leaving the listener to reflect in solitude.

Wonderful songwriting and incredible dynamics surround the boundless emotional core on _More Constant Than The Gods_. Each and every track is precious in its pain and power. Subrosa plays the massive against the melancholic, heaviness against heartache, anger against affection, depression against devotion. They wrap sorrow and serenity around burliness and boldness to create songs overflowing with despair, ecstasy and passion. Many doom bands pry the soul from the chest but none do it quite like Subrosa. _More Constant Than The Gods_ will sweep you up in its embrace like a long lost lover, never to let go.
