**By Jason Wellwood**

This interview was conducted with **Dave Brockie/Oderus Urungus** of **GWAR** at the end of August, prior to the release of _Battle Maximus_. Originally, the interview aired on my show 'Witchfinder Radio', on September 16th, the day before the album was released. Feel free to check out the playlist [here](http://www.facebook.com/notes/witchfinder-radio/witchfinder-radio-playlist-for-september-16th-2013/661810760495855)!

Admittedly, this was one of the most confusing interviews I’ve had in awhile. I had a hard time keeping track of whether I was speaking with Dave Brockie or Oderus Urungus. In fact, I’m pretty sure that there are sentences where the personalities change halfway through, which ended up with me throwing all of my questions out the window and just going with the ‘feel’. The end of the interview was particularly funny for me, usually I ask for a station ID after I say ‘thank you’ and cut the interview there. Dave apparently mistook my response to his command play the album a whole lot as a finish to the interview and he hung up before I could ask. Well, it made me laugh anyway…have a listen and enjoy!
