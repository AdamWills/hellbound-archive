Two weeks in a row! That must be some kind of record around here. Truth be told, last night's show was more of a solo mission than a group effort. Sean was still down in Port Dover, ON celebrating Father's Day with his pops and Albert is currently on call for a film he is doing extra work on, so this show was done entirely by Mr. Kevi Metal himself. No surprise then that, for the most part, everything on this show is essentially new releases, as KSP likes to keep it current. Anyway, here's what was heard on last night's show...

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca. Wanna request something or give us shit? (905) 575-2101.

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
