Can't believe we're a week into June and I'm actually debating whether to wear a jacket tonight.  But hey, at least the sun finally came out, so that's a start...

Anyways, warming the unseasonably cold wastelands of Toronto tonight is a terrific touring package featuring Torche, KEN Mode and Lo-Pan at Lee's Palace.  It feels like I haven't seen Torche in a long time, but turns out I last caught 'em last summer when they [toured with COC](http://gruesomeviews.com/2012/06/22/amateur-concert-photography-hour-corrosion-of-conformity-torche-black-cobra-opera-house-june-21-2012/).  But it's been a while since I've seen 'em headline.  I've sorta lost touch with their more recent material, but they always put on a great gig.

KEN Mode, of course, is used to colder climes than this, hailing from Winnipeg and all.  I mean, they [shot a music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xghkx4iuWBM&feature=player_embedded) in the middle of winter with some leather-clad vixens, so yeah...

And put it this way: I dig touring opener Lo-Pan so much that I'm flying down to Brooklyn next month to see them headline with a [shitload of stoner bands](http://www.theeyeofthestonedgoat.com/#!events/c1yi7).  But more on that some other time.

Speaking of triple threats, Lee's is also hosting the [previously mentioned](http://www.hellbound.ca/2013/03/this-figures-to-be-the-female-fronted-tour-of-the-summer-folks/) Kylesa, Blood Ceremony and White Hills package on Tuesday.  OK, so Lazer/Wulf is also on the bill.  What's a Lazer/Wulf?

**Torche, KEN Mode, Lo-Pan @ Lee's Palace, 529 Bloor Street W, Saturday, June 8th.  Doors @ 9, Lo-Pan @ 10.  $18.**

**Kylesa, Blood Ceremony, White Hills, Lazer/Wulf @ Lee’s Palace, Tuesday, June 11th.  Doors @ 7:30, first band @ 8.  $20.50 advance, $25 at the door.**

Peace,

Greg
