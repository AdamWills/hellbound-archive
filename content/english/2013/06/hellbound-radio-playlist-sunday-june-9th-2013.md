Well holy shit, it's a Hellbound Radio playlist! Well, there actually hasn't been a playlist for a while, as it has been nearly a month since we have done the show live. Never fear however, faithful listeners/followers, for Hellbound Radio returned on Sunday night with a show jam packed full of new releases. We were recently at Maryland Deathfest and got loaded up with new music, so there is no shortage of recent releases for us to play on the show, and that is exactly what Kevin and Sean did last night (Albert was unavailable but will be back soon!).

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca. Wanna request something or give us shit? (905) 575-2101.

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
