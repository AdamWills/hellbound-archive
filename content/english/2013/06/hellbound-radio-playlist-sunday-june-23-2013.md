A day later than usual, but here is Sunday night's playlist! We had all three hosts in on the show on Sunday night - for at least 20 minutes at the same time even. Sean was late getting to the show and Albert needed to leave early, so we only had all the team in for a little bit but it was a good show regardless.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca. Wanna request something or give us shit? (905) 575-2101.

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
