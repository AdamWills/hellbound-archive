**Genocide Yellow Pea Soup By Mark Bouffard of DISSECTION**

![Peasoup](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Peasoup-590x393.jpeg) This ain’t no can of [Habitant](http://www.campbellsoup.ca/en-ca/products/habitant)! With fresh, shredded carrot, yellow peas and pancetta, this Quebecois original is the best comfort food for a snowy evening in. The peas had to soak in water overnight, but once you get this soup going, it’s a one-pot deal that can simmer all day.

The result is an embracing bowl of protein-rich, pronounced flavour. The smokiness of the pancetta, a European pork belly, and simple yellow peas are a balanced blend of legume and meat. Carrots are bright and colourful amidst the turmeric-tinged dish.

Serve with a crispy piece of garlic toast and Thornbury Premium Cider.

**Misanthrope’s Last Supper By Deathlord of Abomination and War Apocalypse of BLASPHEMY**

I wouldn’t choose this as my last meal, but I can see why a misanthrope would. Sure, oven-roasted chicken breast, green beans and mash are great, but it’s not too vibrant, precisely why it’s fitting for a solitary night in.

This dish was super easy to make. I sprinkled black pepper, dried red chili and paprika on lean chicken breast, covered and set in the oven to roast. I steamed green beans and made a mash with garlic butter. For a dipping sauce, I blended three with a few drops of Frank’s Red Hot.

**Maple Syrup Pudding Cake By Patrick Pageau of BASTARDATOR**

Ahhhh, Chômeur! Quel goût!

**Patrick Pageau**’s Maple Syrup Pudding Cake is a definitive Canadian dessert. It’s so versatile that it could be the only dessert on a restaurant menu. Do you enjoy the tease of a small ramekin of crème brulee or do you go full throttle and opt for a dense piece of cake? It doesn’t matter – have some Chômeur! You won’t be sorry.

The baking process, however, is not tricky, but messy. I heated up maple syrup and water in a large pot, while preparing vanilla pound cake batter from scratch. When the liquid heated through, I poured it in a medium baking tin that would be used for meat loaf. Once the batter was smooth, I poured it in the pan, covered it with foil and placed it on the top rack of our gas oven at 375 degrees F.

As I was upstairs checking emails, I began to smell burning sugar.

Don’t worry – I already know it was a stupid move.

I didn’t put the pan on a baking sheet, so as the maple syrup was boiling it spilled on to the floor of the oven, turning black and crispy.

After the spill was cleaned up, I continued to bake until the toothpick came out clean.

The result? A warm, rich vanilla cake soaked with 100% pure Canadian maple syrup. The bottom of the pan had the consistency of bread pudding, so I cut a piece and placed a spoonful on top! Tabernac!

It’s not complete until it’s á la mode with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream and a graham cracker. Definitely worth the mess.

Entrenched… in maple goodness. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPAdvy2D5DM
