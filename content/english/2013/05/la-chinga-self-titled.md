**By Gruesome Greg**

Pretty sure this B.C. band’s name is Mexican slang for fucking, which means I like them already. They give us ten tracks of dirty, sleazy heavy petting rock on their debut album, which lasts for nearly 40 minutes—much longer than most chingadas.

“Early Grave” begins with could best be described as a hyper-sexualized wail, announcing the upcoming Led Zeppelin-influenced Rocky Mountain Hop in true Jimmy Page fashion. “Snake Eyes” keeps it going with a slow-rolling groove reminiscent of “Good Times Bad Times,” and actually includes the line “take it sleazy.” Don’t mind if I do…

“Catty!” is actually a little more laid-back, sort of a cross between Fu Manchu and substance-addled Aerosmith, particularly in the vocal department. “Loose My Mind” also offers up some desert-rock grooves, this number being substantially longer at a shade over six minutes, with more of a Kyuss vibe. Really dig the slow, bluesy breaks that have my head nodding in appreciation. This tune takes a pretty sweet psychedelic turn around the four-minute mark before returning to the heavy blues-based goodness. Great, great track.

After more of a southern, country-fried foray in the aptly-named “Country Mile,” which sorta sounds like a Joe Walsh solo cut, the title track brings back the rock at a more frantic pace, this one offering some decent chugging with a snake-like breakdown that lashes out like a Mexican bullwhip. The chorus really hits the upper register, a high-pitched wail that would make Axl Rose wince, but hey, it’s all good…

These guys may not be reinventing the wheel, but as practitioners of the world’s oldest profession, I can dig their modern take on classic rock… ¡Chinga tu madre!
