Bad news good news sort of week: Bad news is my blogging has been spotty as heck due to an unexpected work overload. Good news is, that overload is past and I’m replaying the shows that I forgot to blog about last week! I may actually be making a timeslot change (again) but we’ll see what happens with that in the next few days. Here’s the playlist for the Monday and Tuesday shows for this week in the meantime! Blowing Up The Lakehead features a one hour dedication to Jeff Hanneman at the beginning of the show. If you have any questions, dedications, requests, want to send me music for airplay, etc. the best place to hit me up is at: [www.facebook.com/witchfinderradio](http:// www.facebook.com/witchfinderradio)  or you can email me at: witchfinderradio@luradio.ca Blowing Up The Lakehead Airs (for now) Monday 11pm-2am and Iron Maple airs Tuesday 10pm-1am on CILU or LU Radio 102.7fm in Thunder Bay or worldwide on the web at [www.luradio.ca](http://www.luradio.ca)
