Hey there, Hellbound readers! We are a little behind in playlists, Sean has been too busy with work related things to update everything as much as he should, so here are two weeks worth of playlists.

On this past Sunday, September 29, there was a special guest in the studio with Kevin. Occasional guest co-host [Paul Ferritto](http://www.hellbound.ca/2013/09/happy-2nd-birthday-interview-with-axisofmetal-com/) from [Axisofmetal.com](http://www.axisofmetal.com) dropped by and helped Kevin do the show, so as you will see when you look at the playlist that there is a bit of rare thrash and stoner rock that made the playlist. The week previous to that Kevin was alone steering the good ship Hellbound, but hopefully that will be the last time for a while that Kevin will be doing it solo. Of course, anyone that tuned in that week also was lucky enough to hear the entire [Liberteer](http://www.hellbound.ca/2012/02/liberteer-better-to-die-on-your-feet-than-live-on-your-knees/) album from start to finish - which made it about as good as you could ask for!

Hellbound Radio airs (almost) every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca. Wanna request something or give us shit? (905) 575-2101.

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
