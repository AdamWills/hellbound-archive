Nights like this just don't happen often enough! Bringing together heavy metal and comedy, The Governor's Bash saw its seventh installment come to life at the Bovine Sex Club.

Arriving in time for a sample of **Slyde** during their sound check, it didn't take long for their sound to catch my attention. Vocalist **Nathan** led their charge of energetic riffs and infectiously happy keyboard melodies. I can easily understand why The Governor took note of them at this year's Wacken Metal Battle; they're catchy and super-listenable ("Lies" was particularly addictive) with a taste of prog rock. Their stage presence was through the roof, even with a stand-in drummer. I found myself feeling instantly happier seeing keyboardist **Sarah**'s expressions, as her ear-to-ear grins transformed into epic grimaces and back again.

The venue was packed wall to wall by the time **Godstopper** hit the stage, and all ears were devoted to taking in everything these guys have to offer. This was another first-time listen for me, though I have to admit, I had high expectations. Frontman **Mike** has been a staple of the Toronto scene for a number of years and I've witnessed his intense performances a couple of times; this one was no different. Layering hypnotic vocals over chugging basslines the overall effect was like an inescapable wave of sludge.

Ottawa's death metal/hardcore legends **Fuck the Facts** were the big feature of the night, and the crowd was absolutely losing it from the moment they went on. It's been about two years since their last Toronto appearance, and eager fans knew exactly what to expect. I did too; this wasn't the first time I've been exposed to FtF's particular brand of grindcore. I knew I was in for ear-splitting shrieks and growls and absurdly fast, technical riffs, and they did not disappoint.
