**By Steve Earles**

I expected an album featuring the talents of **Bruce Soord** from **The Pineapple Thief** and **Jonas Renkse** from **Katatonia** to be special, and I was not disappointed. Every song on this album is special, beautifully written and running the full range of human emotion. Even on one listen the songâ€™s subtle hooks had embedded themselves in my mind. Opening track "Pleasure" is heavy and light in equal measures. The title track is resolutely itself, and haunting. "Frozen North" is just so evocative, this is heavy in a new way. Soord handles all the instruments and is a virtuoso, I have to say though, that it is his guitar playing that truly excels, he brings to mind the subtle mastery and emotion of David Gilmour. Renske is the perfect singer for this album, feeling every word he sings.

Brave, moving and highly recommended.
