You might recall that a few weeks ago [Bill Adams reviewed _Furiosity_](http://www.hellbound.ca/2013/06/monster-truck-furiosity/), the new album by Hamilton ON stoner/hard rock quartet **Monster Truck**. The band recently released their debut album, which has been doing quite well for them out of the gate.

The band recently had the opportunity to perform at Download 2013 in the UK, one of the bigger UK hard rock/metal fests and they have just released a video of a song from their performance there. Please take a look at our hometown boys playing Furiosity's lead off track "Old Train" before thousands of UK punters recently.
