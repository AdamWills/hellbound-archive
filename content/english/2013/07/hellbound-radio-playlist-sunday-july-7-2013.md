So, as you may or may not have noticed, we took June 30th off to spend with our significant others and get ready for Canada Day. However, we were back in full force this past Sunday - or at least Kevi Metal was. Yes, we made Mr. Metal do a solo show once again, but thankfully he had loads of new stuff to play. Here's what he spun...

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca. Wanna request something or give us shit? (905) 575-2101.

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
