I have a few fond memories of the College St. Mexican restaurant/indie-rock dive-bar, not all of which involve underage drinking.  But aside from a handful of local shows, there's rarely been anything heavier than Hot Little Rocket (look 'em up) home, home on the Ranch... until now.

New York psych-rockers Naam are kicking off their [extensive North American tour](https://www.facebook.com/events/484285744981450/) tonight with a hometown gig, and as such, it won't be long before they hit Toronto--Tuesday, to be precise.  I've heard conflicting information as to whether there's any touring support, but I do know that locals On the Verge and Ayahuasca will also be on the bill.  No word as to whether the latter will be bringing any [Amazonian psychoactive brew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) with them, mind you...

Then, in a couple weeks' time, we get a sludgy sandwich of sludginess on Wednesday the 24th.  Rhode Islands rampagers Howl are on tour with Lord Dying, a pretty decent new band from Portland.  Come early for local openers Pyres--I just heard their new album, and it sounds amazing!

That's right folks, there are not one, but two heavy rock/metal shows at Rancho Relaxo this month.  Put that in your taco and eat it!

**Naam, Ayahuasca, On the Verge @ Rancho Relaxo, Tuesday, July 9th.  Doors @ 8.  $10.**

**Howl, Lord Dying, Pyres @ Rancho Relaxo, Wednesday, July 24th.  Doors @ 8.  $10.**

Peace,

Greg
