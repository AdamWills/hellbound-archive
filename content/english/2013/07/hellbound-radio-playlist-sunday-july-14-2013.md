It's almost time for the next show, so it's about time we get last Sunday's playlist up on the site. This show started out as a Kevin solo show, but Sean finally showed up around 9:50 to accompany Mr KSP for the remainder of the program. Included on this week's show was a rarity from the 70s that predates Iron Maiden, a song from Adrian Smith's pre-Maiden band Urchin that will appeal to anyone that likes Thin Lizzy or UFO

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca. Wanna request something or give us shit? (905) 575-2101.

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
