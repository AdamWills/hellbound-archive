**By Sean Palmerston**

In early April occasional Hellbound.ca contributor **Jared Hynes** sent me an email asking me if I wanted to go in with him to order the newest demo from Sweden's death/thrash/black metal combo **Hypertension**. Jared always has great taste, so when he sent me their bandcamp site and I sat down and checked them out I immediately said yes and asked him to include me in on the order.

In late May we received a package of cassettes of the band's debut album, _Primeval Tryants Prevails_, which I have been listening to almost non-stop for the past few months. It's easy to see exactly what it is that I like so much about this debut: the band sounds like a mixture of Razor, Venom and Motorhead with a bit of early Death mixed in. This could have come out as easily in 1987 as 2013 and, if it had, would be spoken now of in wide-eyed reverence.

Anyway, here it is, in its entirety. Give _Primeval Tryants Prevails_ a listen and if you like go and support them via [their bandcamp page](http://hypertension.bandcamp.com/album/primeval-tyrants-prevails).
