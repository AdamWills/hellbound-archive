The hardcore show of the summer (because summer doesn't end till September 21st) takes place in Baltimore next month as the 25th anniversary tour of Eyehategod and the 30th anniversary tour of Agnostic Front collide at the Ottobar September 13th.

But wait, you say, aren't they playing in Delaware the next day?  If you can actually locate Delaware on a map, you must be a better man than I, but nevertheless, there are a few bands playing Baltimore that won't be making the trip to the Blue Hen State.  Like, how about the Cro-Mags, or Iron Reagan, an old-school side-project by the guys in Municipal Waste?  Or the reunited Final Conflict from the West Coast?  Well okay, the latter will be in Wilmington, too--they're also playing [on a boat(!) with EHG that Sunday](http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=3747954&pl=rocksoff), but I digress.

Suffice to say, the triple bill of EHG/AF/Cro-Mags is pretty awesome, and when you consider that there are three other bands on the bill, well, let's just say that I am considering going to this.  Mind you, I've never been to Baltimore before--there are just too many bands at MDF every year whose logos I can't even read--but this might actually be worth the trip if I can make the dollars make sense.

That said, I happen to be Facebook friends with a promoter who puts on a lotta hardcore/metal shows in the area, including this one, and upon mentioning my intentions, I was promised "Free drinks for you all night if you & friends make it from Canada."  So that's one expense I wouldn't hafta worry about, heh heh.

Not sure whether this offer applies to all Canadians, mind you... ;)

**Eyehategod, Agnostic Front, Cro-Mags, Final Conflict, Iron Reagan, Coke Bust @ Ottobar, 2549 N Howard Street, Baltimore, MD, Friday, September 13th.  $35.**

Peace,

Greg
