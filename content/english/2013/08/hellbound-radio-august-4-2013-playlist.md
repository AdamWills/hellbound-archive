For this week's edition of HELLBOUND RADIO there was an old familiar face in the control booth with Kevin. Former Hellbound co-host Matt Lewis was Kevin's special guest on Sunday night. He was in town to speak with Kevin about his upcoming Southern Ontario Metal Fest, which we will be giving away tickets for next week on this very website! I was glad to have Matt in with Kevin, especially as I was caught waiting at the border to get back into Canada for almost two hours on Sunday night and didn't make the show!

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca. Wanna request something or give us shit? (905) 575-2101.
