**By Ola Mazzuca**

Scruffy Swedish rockers **Graveyard** sound like they’ve been around for a while. Maybe it’s their classic approach that’s reminiscent of old school Nazareth. Or perhaps it’s that elegiac shriek by vocalist **Joakim Nissim** that peaks in rebellious riffs amid psychedelic drone. The band hails from Gothenburg, one of the death metal capitals of the world, but they’re better off with a nostalgic sound properly dashed with European flavour.

_Lights Out_ is merely a re-hash of traditional elements Graveyard has borrowed from genre pioneers of classic rock, prog, doom and psychedelic music. “An Industry of Murder” is a radical way to begin with a squealing guitar solo and great tempo variation. “Slow Motion Countdown”, is an eerily identical spin off of Black Sabbath’s “Soldier of Fortune” a la Opeth, with a pace that follows its title through Nissim’s emotive lyrics and chiming keys.

Graveyard gets angsty and political on “The Suits, The Law & The Uniforms,” fighting for freedom against the Man, while “Hard Times Lovin’” is a wicked bar track and serenade for the tough gals. “Fool in the End” is a catchy track as **Axel Sjöberg**’s snare leads Nissim as he spews raspy words of remorse.

_Lights Out_ goes perfectly dim on “20/20 (Tunnel Vision)”, a closing track that progresses from a slow start of vocals in galloping unison, pronunciation of each instrument, no matter how slow each note, before bursting into the clarity of bluesy, organ-laden, sporadic riffs. Graveyard doesn’t go out with a bang, but rather a quiet death of a chord, buried after a rusty, yet solid climax.

Graveyard follow suit to their name, like a rusty tombstone, symbolizing age and progression over time. If cleaned properly, you’ll find a treasure once forgotten, or an antique piece like _Lights Out_, that just needs to be revisited.
