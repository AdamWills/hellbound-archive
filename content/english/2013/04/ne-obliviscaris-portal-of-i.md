**Guest review by Catherine Morris** _Portal of I_ is the long-awaited debut from Australian progressive extreme metallers **Ne Obliviscaris**, and what a debut it is. Beauty and brutality go hand in hand in this exceptional offering, which is sonically somewhat schizophrenic: at times tipping over into melodious, dreamy post-BM territory; at others brimming with pure, raw ferocity and despair.

The band's musicianship and technicality are pretty much impossible to find fault with. The elegant juxtaposition of sounds, like **Tim Charles**' haunting, high-pitched violin layered with **Xenoyr**'s screams, and the contrasting melodic and heavy passages, are what make _Ne Obliviscaris_ a cut above the rest - all the elements are well-balanced and used sparsely for maximum effect. The songs themselves are massive, living breathing things: opening track 'Tapestry of the Starless Abstract' swings between delicate, stripped-down acoustic sections and densely layered, aggressive metal with growling vocals. Meanwhile, the intro of 'Of the Leper Butterflies' is mellow, almost jazzy, with an improvised-feel, while 'Forget Not', the longest track on the album, pretty much covers all bases as it grows from acoustic guitars to heart-breaking ascending strings to blackened screaming vocals. It’s rare for highly technical and progressive music to be able to convey and provoke so many emotions, but _Portal…_ more than accomplishes this. Everything is here – agony, frustration, euphoria...

Overall, this album is a triumph. Its complexity may make it a little hard for some people to swallow, but Portal of I is a hugely ambitious and multifaceted debut which is not only a great achievement for the band, but also sure to become a seminal album of the genre.
