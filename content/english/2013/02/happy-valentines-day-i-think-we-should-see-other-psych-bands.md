Judging by the great gigs that have already been booked, April is bound to be a massive month for metal in Toronto.  But to get there, we gotta get through winter, first.  There's usually not a lot going on in February, which is okay, cuz the weather's generally too cold to make a fat, lazy bastard like myself feel inclined to go outside.  But there are at least a couple local gigs I'll be bundling up for in the upcoming weeks...

Suffice to say, the dudes in Quest For Fire must have a wicked sense of humour.  I mean, who breaks up the day after Valentine's Day?  Well, these Toronto heavy-psych stalwarts, apparently.  The band is playing [its last show](https://www.facebook.com/events/266050956855693/) on Friday, February 15th with assistance from Brooklyn-based Tee Pee labelmates Naam, who'd surely be worth the price of admission on their own.  Online response to this news has been great enough that the Horseshoe Tavern is actually selling advanced tickets at the price of 10 dollars.  You can also get 'em at Rotate This and Soundscapes.

Alas, while this month marks the end for QFF, it's a new beginning for Blood Ceremony--their first gig of 2013, that is.  The occult rockers are playing the Silver Dollar on the 21st (it's a Thursday) with support from a new local psych band by the name of Hollow Earth.  Because the local psych scene could definitely use some new blood.  Those are some pretty big shoes to fill, mind you!

....

And on a non-metal (and not quite February) note, I'm taking my show to the stage, doing some standup at Absolute Comedy on Sunday, March 3rd.  It's an afternoon gig with a 3 pm start, and I'll be one of many funny folks on the bill.  If you haven't flipped your calendar over to March yet, don't worry.  There'll be plenty of reminders from yours truly in the coming weeks. ;)

**Quest For Fire with Naam, Surinam @ Horseshoe Tavern, 370 Queen St W, Friday, February 15th.  First band @ 10.  $10 advance, $12 at the door.**

**Blood Ceremony with Hollow Earth, Wicked Witches @ Silver Dollar Room, 486 Spadina Ave, Thursday, February 21st.  First band @ 9:45.  $10 at the door (advance tickets TBA).**

**Amateur Sunday Afternoon feat. Gruesome Greg (+10 other comedians) @ Absolute Comedy, 2335 Yonge St, Sunday, March 3rd. Doors @ 2:30, show starts @ 3 pm.  $5.**

Peace,

Greg
