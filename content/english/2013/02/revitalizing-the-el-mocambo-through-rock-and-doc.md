Do you remember seeing the **Rolling Stones** play “Brown Sugar” at the **El Mocambo**, a Molson Canadian in hand? Or maybe you were present for the live recording of a **Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble** show? Maybe you weren’t even born! Whatever the case, you’re probably interested in this prolific concert venue in Toronto’s vibrant Chinatown.

On Spadina Avenue, just south of College Street, the fluorescent palm tree sign of the “El Mo” still shines bright. The legendary music venue has seen many changes since it’s opening in 1850, and has been preserved in a new documentary.

**_Under the Neon Palms_** is a 2012 documentary produced by students from the Ryerson School of Journalism. Derek Kirk, Patricia Skagen, Amanda Macchia, Lucy Screnci and Kailah Bharath capture stories that shaped the rich history of a landmark that both hosted and harvested Toronto’s diverse landscape of sounds.

Delving into the El Mo’s long-standing structure and those that resonate within it, _Under the Neon Palms_ focuses on its new owners, **Sam Grosso** and **Marco Petrucci**, who want to bring El Mocambo back to its heyday that celebrated one thing whole-heartedly: rock ‘n’ roll.

The documentary features interviews with musicians and public figures that were part of this vivacious time in Toronto. From blues guitarist **Danny Mark**s to music journalist **Peter Goddard**, they share their experiences, reflect on El Mocambo history and ponder about its potential to relive its glory days to reclaim its position as an active part of Toronto’s music scene.

The crew will be hosting a private screening of _Under the Neon Palms_ on **Thursday, February 28** at **8:00pm** as part of an El Mocambo revival concert with sets by:
