Last night **Sacha Dunable** of **Intronaut** joined **Meshuggah** live on stage at Centre Stage in Atlanta, GA. Meshuggah frontman **Jens Kidman** has the flu and the band have told him he can't talk when not on stage, so they asked Sacha to help a little bit by singing the final song of their set ("New Millenium Cyanide Christ") last night. Check out the youtube footage below

Intronaut is currently on tour with Meshuggah and Animals as Leaders across North America.
