![Gojira](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Gojira07-590x393.jpg) **Review and photos by Adam Wills**

A capacity crowd came together at Toronto's Phoenix Concert Theatre last week to witness France's mighty **Gojira**, Canada's own **Devin Townsend Project**, and Chicago's critically acclaimed **The Atlas Moth**, and what a show it was.

**The Atlas Moth** opened things up with a set consisting of mostly material from their 2011 release, [_An Ache for the Distance_](http://www.hellbound.ca/2011/10/the-atlas-moth-an-ache-for-the-distance/) (Profound Lore), intricately managing a battle between atmosphere and intensity.

**Devin Townsend** and company returned again (do these guys ever take a break from touring?), this time in a support capacity.  A 7 song set, ranging from _Infinity_ to their latest release, _Epicloud_, featured Townsend being his usual self, a caricature of a heavy metal frontman. Ending with "Grace", Townsend promotes happiness, positivity and love - and leaves everyone with a smile on their face (and even jazz hands).

**Gojira** delivered one of the most crushing sets I've heard in a long while, and frontman **Joe Duplantier** knows how to take control of a crowd. From opener "Explosia" to closer "The Gift of Guilt", Gojira showed why they're one of metal's next big things.
