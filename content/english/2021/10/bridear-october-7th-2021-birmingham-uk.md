It is not very often we see a Japanese band playing in Birmingham; therefore I did not want to miss the chance to catch _Bridear_ \- an all female heavy metal band performing live at the _Castle & Falcon_.

Setting sights on the global stage, _Bridear_ began hitting the road at the end of September to tour Europe and the UK in support of their most recent release _Bloody Bride_ (released May 7th, 2021 via Setsuzoku Records). This makes them the first Japanese band to perform in the UK post-pandemic.

Tonight’s setlist was a mixture of oldies for long time fans and new tracks from band’s latest album. The evening was a proof that sticking to their high energy power metal formula- thrash beats, double kicks, big riffs and super melodic guitar solos - _Bridear_ has created big numbers and quite a reasonable, loyal fan following.

As _Bridear_ was going through their speedy, yet sugar coated anthems, it was great to see a mixed crowd of all ages and nationalities; rocking _Bridear’s_ T-Shirts, fist pumping with the rhythm and singing along. While _Haru's_ (Bassist) dark growls were mixing with _Kimi’s_ clean lead vocals, there was plenty of fretboard wizardry from _Misaki_ (Guitarist), Ayumi (Guitarist) and _Natsumi_ hiding behind the drum kit was a real powerhouse.

The night finished with _Light In The Dark,_ a piece from _Bridear's_ 2016 album _Baryte_, leaving fans wanting more. Before everyone hit the merch stand at the end of the night, the quintet came back to play _Again,_ a finale track from the 2019 release _Expose Your Emotions_.
