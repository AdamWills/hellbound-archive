This Saturday night the fine folks at **UXB Press** have created a cool event happening at S**onic Boom Records** in Toronto. They have arranged an autograph signing for their new [Eve Of Darkness book](https://hellbound.ca/2021/09/eve-of-darkness-book/), which will feature members of **Razor**, **Sacrifice** and **Slaughter**.

Those in attendance will be entered into a draw for test pressings of the upcoming Sacrifice and Slaughter "Live in 1985" LPs that are being released by Toronto's Cursed Blessings label. Pre-orders for both albums start on Saturday night as well over at [this site](https://cursed-blessings-records.myshopify.com/).

All band members will be able to sign two pieces per person. Choose wisely!
