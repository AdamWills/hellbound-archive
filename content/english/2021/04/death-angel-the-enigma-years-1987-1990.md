_Death Angel_ were one of the very best metal bands to come out of the 80's (and that is no mean feat in the decade that gave us amazing music from bands like _Sabbat, Metallica, Bathory, Slayer, Venom, Voivod, Soundgarden, Iron Maiden_, and so many more). It was a magic time, different from this impersonal post-internet void we now "live" in. We will never see it’s like again.

So good were (and indeed, happily, still are) _Death Angel._ They could have been as big as _Metallica._ They had the musicianship, the attitude, the songs, and the X-Factor (compare Cliff Burton era _Metallica_ with now _Metallica_, the magic is hard to replicate). All _Death Angel_ lacked was luck, and hey, it’s a big factor for all of us.

The first CD is their debut, _The Ultra-Violence,_ an absolutely outstanding thrash metal album. As a wonderful extra, included here is the excellent _Kill As One_ demo produced by a certain Kirk Hammett (well produced too, I believe he did a _Blind Illusion_ demo around this time. Now there is a band who also deserve the _Cherry Red Records_ treatment. There’s an idea!)

The second CD contains _Death Angel’s_ second album, the amusingly titled _Frolic Through The Park_. I cannot emphasise the huge progression the band made here while still maintaining their own unique identity. Killer thrash like _3__rd_ _Floor_ and _Road Mutants_ rub shoulders with more left-field tracks like _Bored_ and _Confused_. All metal fans should have this splendid album. Again, some worthy bonus tracks included.

The third CD is the live _Fall From Grace._ Although not sanctioned by the band at the time, it now serves to show what a potent live band they were (and are). The set-list is composed of the first two albums, so no filler, only killer!

The fourth CD is entitled _Rarities_ and is a musical treasure trove, I love it!

This is a beautifully put together collection, and I urge all true lovers of metal to add it to their collections.
