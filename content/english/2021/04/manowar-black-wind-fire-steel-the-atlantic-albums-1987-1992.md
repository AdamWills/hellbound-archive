One of the great cult metal bands of the 1980s, _Manowar_ had four excellent albums under their belts before signing to _Atlantic._

This was the _Manowar’s_ highest profile-era. Their _Atlantic_ debut _Fighting The World_ is one the greatest heavy metal albums, even featuring the great Orson Welles on _Defender_. One of the things that stands out most here, after all these years later, is the great song-writing and musicianship on display. It even comes with a Ken Kelly cover, who did the classic _Rising_ cover from _Rainbow._

_Kings Of Metal_ (1988) continues in the same vein, and again is one of the greatest metal albums.

By the time of _The Triumph Of Steel_ in 1992, the musical world had changed beyond recognition. Grunge, indie and alternative ruled the roost, and in a strange way, _Manowar_ were a complete alternative to this. Holding their heads high, they released an epic metal album with strong progressive influences on the track _Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy In Eight Parts_, which really does deliver what the title says. Time has been kind to this album, seeing it in context, as a brave and moving album.

A great collection for a great unashamedly (rightly so) metal band!
