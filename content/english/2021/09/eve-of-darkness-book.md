Saturday, September 25th will mark the launch of a very important artifact chronicling the history of the heavy metal music scene in the greater Toronto, Ontario area. On that day, UXB Press will be releasing their newest book, entitled **Eve Of Darkness: Toronto Metal in the '80s**. This book is a massive, painstakingly put together tome dedicated to the city's burgeoning heavy scene during its heyday.

On that day, its creators have put together a book launch like no other. Happening at Toronto's **Shacklands Brewery**, it will be a free afternoon of metal camaraderie that will include an open air metal market, DJ sets from artists featured in the book, an all metal karaoke heading into the evening and the launch of a beer in honour of the book's release.

To give you a bit more of an idea about the book, the launch party and what all of it was about I recently sat down with UXB Press co-founder **Derek Emerson** to find out some more about what those in attendance can expect.

**First off, I wanted to say that Eve Of Darkness is an outstanding aural and visual history of heavy metal in Toronto in the 1980s. How did the idea to do this book come into vision?**

Thanks for the kind words Sean! As a teen, I was deeply committed to and inspired by Toronto’s heavy metal atmosphere. Discovering heavier bands emerging in the early 80’s like **Venom**, **Accept**, **Exciter** and in particular **Anvil**, who came from the same city I lived in, blew my mind. Could a band releasing such incredible metallic anthems as "Mothra" and "666" really live just down the road?! Wow!! I began tape trading in 1983 and soon discovered pockets of ’extreme’ metal bands popping up all over the planet. These discoveries inspired me and my friend **Glenn Salter** to start a fanzine called **Metallic Assault**. We were compelled to tell more people in our city about these new amazing bands they’d yet to hear. By fall 1984 we gathered enough material to print our first issue. The idea for Eve Of Darkness stems from the joy we derived in discovering those bands and helping develop the local metal scene to a point where our city was producing our own bands of a similar calibre. I’ve always felt compelled to shine a light on overlooked artists whose work I enjoy - talented yet under-appreciated musicians who deserve much more attention than they received at the time. Now is our chance to right those wrongs and share their stories with a wider audience.

**This is your second book, the first being about Toronto hardcore during the 1980s. Was the idea of doing one on Toronto metal in the 80s something that was always on the plate, or was it something that was decided upon after the success of the first book?**

Our original plan was to showcase Toronto’s punk and metal scenes of the 80’s in one book however as we began to compile materials it quickly became clear that two books would be required to do each of these scenes justice. In reality, readers will only ever see 15-20% of the material we gathered due to space constraints. Both scenes were very vibrant and productive during that era.

**There is a lot of work to do a book like this - literally hundreds and hundreds of hours of interviews with all sort of artists. You must have assembled an army of people to do this. What can you tell me about the process of putting your team together and how you got it all to work?**

True, it takes thousands of hours of work to complete a project like this, from interviews to scanning visuals, editing to design and layout, print production and distribution. There are countless tasks so having a solid team is crucial. At the outset, **Shawn Chirrey** (Still Thinking fanzine / record label) and I agreed to form UXB Press with the intent of producing high quality books that showcase the local scenes we grew up in. A passionate writer, **Simon Harvey** (Ugly Pop Records), quickly joined our crew as did **Fran Grasso** (Urbain Grandier Records), **Paul Morris** and **Tim Freeborn** (from 80’s TOHC band Sons Of Ishmael) with several other friends lending their support along the way. As we started work on Eve Of Darkness, life long metal enthusiast **Chris Turner** (Sacrament AD,Festered Corpse) joined the fold. His passion for the subject proved a great addition to an already strong team. On the design end, **Goods + Services Branding** threw their creative muscle behind both book projects and as you will see, their efforts produced stunning results.

**How exactly did you first come to be part of Toronto's metal scene in its infancy?**

As a kid in the 70’s we were bombarded by music – disco, funk, soul and of course hard rock. Like many of my peers, **KISS** made a huge impact on this 7 year old kid. In fact my dad took me to see them as my first real rock concert. By the late 70’s **Black Sabbath**, **Judas Priest**, **Van Halen**, etc... were my soundtrack. There was a TV show in Toronto at the time called **The New Music** which promoted exactly what the name says – providing exposure for NWOBHM, punk, new wave music in a time before MTV existed. That show provided a window into a wild world of possibilities. As mentioned earlier, discovering Anvil who hailed from the same city as me, was a revelation. This made me curious to find out what other bands were active locally – finding records by **Rapid Tears**, **Banshee** and **Minotaur**, watching **Savage Steel** play a dive bar in Mississauga, meeting **Terry Sadler / Slaughter** crew at Record Peddler as they were just forming the band... these experiences intensifed our passion for the music and lifestyle. As our bonds formed with these like minded people, our confidence to tackle the task of releasing Toronto’s first zine featuring ’underground’ or ’extreme’ metal grew.

**As someone who was very involved in the earliest days of heavy metal and thrash in the 1980s, and without spoiling too much from the book, what do you think were the most important events that defined the Toronto metal scene?**

Although it’s impossible to pinpoint many of the behind-the-scenes moments that helped the scene thrive, what we attempt to do in the book is to highlight a handful of gigs by touring bands who showed the way to local metalheads coming up in the ranks. Early appearances by **Judas Priest** (El Mocambo in 1979), Motorhead (1981 + 82), Iron Maiden (1981 + 82), Slayer (1984), Metallica (1985), Celtic Frost (1986), etc... – all of these shows and more are covered in details with stories and photos from those in attendance. These events provided the spark for many locals to form bands, start zines, form record labels, etc... Now you’ll get to read these stories firsthand from those who lived it.

**You were doing your own metal zine in the mid to early 80s, entitled Metallic Assault. Apart from the fact that you were a teenager and it was a different time, how do you find that your own tastes and opinions on the 80s metal scene have evolved from those days to now?**

Like many others, my musical tastes have expanded over the years but there’s never been a time that I’ve stopped listening to metal from the 80’s, be it local or international, uber obscure or semi-main stream releases. I am proud of what we were able to achieve in Toronto at that time and feel privileged to be able to commemorate the bands, zines, labels, promoters, record stores, etc... of the era via Eve Of Darkness.

**Instead of concentrating entirely on the underground metal scene, the book spans the gamut from early heavy metal (Anvil, Icon, Lee Aaron) to death and thrash (Slaughter, Razor, Sacrifice) to the city's hair metal scene (Slash Puppet, Sebastian Bach, Killer Dwarves). There were so many different types of scenes in the city and you manage to hit upon all of them. How difficult was it to research and find information?**

Admittedly my background was firmly rooted in the thrash (or ‘speed metal’ as it was called back then) camp. **Larry’s Hideaway** was our home away from home and it was rare that we would visit venues like the **Gasworks** or **Rock N Roll Heaven**. That said, it felt like a project like that needs to include all elements of Toronto’s metal scene of that time and the glam scene definitely thrived during that era. We connected with numerous members of the glam scene, some of whom we only knew from a distance at that time, who became invaluable to helping us tell their collective stories. We are quite happy with the inclusive approach we took to making sure all factions of the local metal scene are covered.

**The two biggest hard rock bands in Toronto are pretty much left out of this book. Having more on both Rush and Triumph would arguably sell more copies. Did you feel that their influence on this scene wasn't important enough to cover or were they unavailable for interviews?**

Both bands were huge influences on many of us growing up, and that influence is touched upon in the introduction chapter but ultimately their most influential periods on local teens occurred in the late 70’s so to focus too much on their already well documented achievements felt unnecessary. As mentioned earlier, giving exposure to incredible bands who haven’t received the accolades we feel are due is much more important to us than including namecheck worthy bands to simply sell more books. That said, if Geddy or Alex happen to be reading this and want to invite us to hoist a pint in celebration of Eve Of Darkness’ release, we will be happy to accept their generous invitation. Lol

**Were there bands or people that you reached out to be part of the book that you were unable to reach? Alternately, how many bands came to you looking to be covered in the book that you were unfamiliar with before starting the book?**

Thankfully only two or three people escaped our search; the vast majority of local bands and personalities make appearances in one form or another within Eve Of Darkness. We made a few very cool band discoveries along the way including one in particular that was something of a revelation.

Without spoiling the surprise, this mystery band turned up a slew of high quality studio master tapes that have remained unheard by virtually anyone since they were laid to tape in 1980-81. We digitized the masters to discover the mysteries they’d been hiding for four decades and wow, we were shocked at the absolutely top tier songwriting and audio quality! To discover an authentic NWOBHM era treasure like this is absolutely incredible. Plans are currently underway to release these recordings via a partnership between Urbain Grandier Records and UXB Press, coming late spring / early summer 2022. This is something you’ve got to hear to believe!

**The book does a great job revisiting the venues and the stores that were very important to the growth of metal in Toronto. The Record Peddler in particular seems to be one of the main catalysts of the growth of metal in Toronto. For those unfamiliar, how would you describe the Peddler, what it was and how important it was.**

**Record Peddler** was like mecca not only for the underground metal crowd but also punks, goths, etc… basically anyone seeking new music coming from fringe / independent artists and labels. They hired very knowledgeable (some might say curmudgeonly) staff who would get to know customers and recommend new releases based on their previous purchases. The store would always have new, enlightening music blaring from their stereo. They were also very open to accepting material on consignment; a key factor in the support of local bands, zines, etc.. Peddler fostered a real community-building atmosphere, with people meeting amidst the record bins, talking about forming bands, starting zines, putting on gigs. In fact, Diabolic Force Records boss Brian Taylor, who worked at the store, recruited bands like Sacrifice, Slaughter and others while working at the front counter, to record their first demo and vinyl releases on his label. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of the revered institution that was the Record Peddler.

**The book illustrates that Toronto, while having some level of international success, had a lot of bands that never got "that big break". Who do you think are the unsung, forgotten bands from the 80s scene that should have broken big but for different reasons did not?**

So many bands to mention, such little space here. Suffice to say there are many who we feel deserved that ‘big break’ and with Eve Of Darkness we are doing our small part to help deliver some posthumous attention their way.

**If there was a Toronto 80s heavy metal hall of fame, who would be the first inductees and what do you think their reactions would be to getting the nod?**

No doubt Anvil would be near, if not top, of the inductee list. Their early work is unquestionably impressive and influential, as the testimonials from Slash, Anthrax, and Metallica during the intro of their documentary confirms. Anvil’s reaction to getting the nod? Well, if I know Robb Reiner, and I sort of think I do, he would be 100% certain that Anvil deserves it. Lol And in my opinion, he would be 100% correct.

**The layout of the book is very bold in red, black and white. When I look at it, I am immediately reminded of Metallica's _Kill Em All_ and Celtic Frost's _Morbid Tales_. What was the inspiration that gave you the idea to do the book and packaging in these colours?** 

You nailed it pretty much on the head. Those two releases along with the first Exciter and **Hellhammer** records encapsulate the look and feel we are seeking to celebrate.

**It is becoming more commonplace for metal records to be released in limited edition "diehard" editions with bonus materials, stickers, patches, posters, etc and - in great metal tradition -  your book is being released in a diehard edition that is absolutely incredible. Can you describe what is available for those that decide to spend the extra money for the diehard?**

We decided to have some fun the the Die Hard edition. We thought, if we could’ve created band merch / ephemera back then, what would have been fun to see. We started by reimaginged the rock mirrors you could win at the CNE during the 80’s, adorned with images of Ozzy, Ratt, Motley Crue which were fine, but what if we could’ve won **Sacrifice** or **Lee Aaron** mirrors to hang in our school lockers – how fun would that have been?! From there we figured, trading cards of some of our favourite bands would be cool, let’s do those too! Eve Of Darkness (the book) provides an insiders peek at how we the participants themselves viewed the Toronto scene / bands. We thought it would be fun to view things from an outsider-looking-in perspective so we created ‘**Exhumed Incantations**’ - a 24 page fanzine collecting articles, reviews and other press clippings written during the 80’s, spanning sources from all over the globe. There are a few more odds and ends included in the Die Hard edition that should definitely entertain those who are eager for a deeper dive into Toronto’s metal history.

**You are having a public book launch event for Eve of Darkness on Saturday, September 25th. Can you explain exactly what will be happening, where it will be happening and what the cost is for those that would like to attend?**

We are thrilled to finally let everyone see what we’ve been working on over the past 2.5- 3 years. We hope they will agree it was worth the wait. Our book release party is taking place at **[Shacklands Brewery (100 Symes Road, Toronto)](https://shacklands.com/)** on Saturday September 25th . In order to accommodate a larger audience during these times of covid restrictions, the entire event will take place outdoors and it is free to attend. There will be an 80’s focused Heavy Metal Market running from noon until 6pm that day featuring local and out-of-town vendors selling vintage vinyl, shirts, pins, flags and more. Guest DJ’s, most of whom appear in the book, will be playing their favorite metal records of the 80’s – music that inspired them to join the scene, start a band, etc… As the sun begins to set, Metal Karaoke kicks into high gear. Guests are invied to shout along to Priest, Accept, Slayer, Van Halen, Metallica, Anvil, Ratt, Maiden, etc… hundreds of songs to choose from. If you are interested in 80’s heavy metal you NEED to attend this event!

**Thanks for your time in answering these interview questions. Any closing remarks that you would like to leave with the Hellbound readers?**

I think the intro to the book sums it up best. We bonded in hallowed concert halls, gritty taverns and bustling record stores, weathered denim and studded leather our uniform. Unyielding, unappologetic, uncompromising. Now is the eve of darkness, when the legacy of early Toronto heavy metal echoes across continents, oceans and decades, conquering the souls of new generations of the faithful. Now is our Eve Of Darkness.
