![Hellbound-Logo-Icon](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Hellbound-Logo-Icon.png)This is an excellent three-track introduction to a very worthy band. On the title track and "Potsdam Glo," the band show a talent for strong, original atmospheric doom. My only criticism is a constructive one: I’d like to see the vocal more forward in the mix.

Interestingly, what sums up Norilsk the best is their superb cover of Voivod’s "Negatron," faithful to the original, yet startling different. It is this original, very Canadian approach to doom that is Norilsk’s great strength. I look forward to a full length album from this fine group where they can push and hone their sound even further.
