This NYC heavy psych duo—they’ve been through more drummers than Spinal Tap—has also been pretty prolific with its recorded output, although some of their earlier stuff was largely unavailable outside The Big Apple.  Such was the case with _Glitter Glamour Atrocity_, **White Hills**' third album (of 13… so far!), originally released in 2007, but recently reissued by Thrill Jockey Records.

“Air Waves” kicks things off with some spacey keyboards, before “Under Skin or By Name” ushers in the jangly, airy space-rock riffage. Hawkwind is definitely a major reference point, but they also remind me of more modern bands like Dead Meadow, who were probably cutting their teeth around the same time on the East Coast (if not a bit sooner).  “Spirit of Exile” is a much mellower tune, on the verge of electronica, whereas “Distance” is a little more Floydian… well, Pink Floyd meets Sunn O)))).

Things get lengthier and trippier as we hit the homestretch, with “Long Serve Remember” offering up 10 minutes of fuzzed-out psych-rock riffage and unsettling drone.  The tune slows to a crawl halfway through, with an actual lullabye giving way to Dubya Bush talking WMDs.  (No, really!)  The 14-minute title track brings back the Hawkwind-style riff attack, complete with the swirling synths the Hawks made famous… and more 9/11-related sound clips, as well.  Nothing wrong with a little Hawkwind worship, though there’s much more than that on this record.
