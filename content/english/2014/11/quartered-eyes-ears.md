As an Irishman, I’m constantly astonished at the sheer quality and diversity of the bands Canada is producing. That this album is a self-release proves my points. The quality of the production, the musicianship, and the all-important songs would put many major league bands to shame.

Heavy, but never without hooks and melody, this is a band with something to say, and they rightly want it heard. They’re very progressive, but never at the expense of the songs.

The album artwork is fabulous and well-thought out, tying in with the album’s themes.

Overall a band that are going places and deserve the widest possible audience.

(Self-Released)
