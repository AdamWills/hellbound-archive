Yes, [black metal theory](http://helvetejournal.org/) is apparently now a thing. But even lay-kvltists will no doubt be delighted to find **_Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult_** under the tree on Xmas Day. **Dayal Patterson**’s weighty but fascinating reference tome is sure to please both budding corpse-painted academics and ordinary, everyday acolytes of infernal putrescence — get your copy signed with extra material at [Evolution Of The Cult.com](http://www.evolutionofthecult.com/).

Stainless steel collar stays / bottle openers\[/caption\]

#### From Gruesome Greg

For the true metal head at the office, these collar stays will keep shirts looking sharp with 316L Grade Stainless Steel.  They can even be used as a bottle opener...y'know, for the office party. $1 to $1.80 apiece, according to [this semi-sketchy Indian website](http://collarstays.in/metal-collar-stays.html).

Stocking stuffers are heavy metal books! Metal books are important to the scene because metalheads are always learning more and more about new bands as well as heavy metal history. They're also important for giving fans something they can relate to and discuss! Great ones are _Lords of Chaos_, _Mean Deviation_, _Choosing Death_, _Swedish Death Metal_, and _Only Death_ is real, many of which can be found at [Bazillionpoints.com](http://www.bazillionpoints.com/).

For those in the more extreme frost-bitten zones, why not some great toques and beanies to keep the precious metal fans' ears and head warm during the winter months while representing your favourite band or movie? They don't even have to be metal ones: horror or sci-fi flicks will do! [Heavy Metal Merchant](http://www.heavymetalmerchant.com/products/beanies), [Indie Merch Store](https://www.indiemerchstore.com/index.php?pg=0&c=101&lim=72) and [Fear Shop](http://www.fearshop.com/heavy-metal-hats.asp#.VHZPnFfF-f-) have several options to choose from: the Mercyful Fate trucker hat (Indie Merch), the Behemoth Furor Divinus Beanie (Heavy Metal Merchant), or this Halloween / Michael Meyers baseball cap from Fear Shop.

**1\. Metal Cat Mug and Shirt by Black Craft Cult** New York based clothing company [Black Craft Cult](http://www.blackcraftcult.com/) was created under the guiding motto "Create your own future." The brand combines seriously cool black and white designs with the type of satanic and occult themes that most metal heads can appreciate. Maybe one of the coolest things in their catalogue? This "Lucipurrr" shirt which features an evil kitty complete with inverted cross. Combine it with the mug pictured here and you've got yourself the perfect cat lover's gift set.

**2\. Black Metal Cologne Oil** Who'd want to smell like teen spirit when they can smell like corpse paint instead? This roll on cologne from [Etsy seller Soapopotamus](https://www.etsy.com/shop/soapopotamus) is a [unisex fragrance designed to complement the frost bitten Norwegian in all of us](https://www.etsy.com/listing/112333122/black-metal-cologne-oil?ref=shop_home_active_7). Blending notes of moss, bark, resin, pepper, musk and leather, it is described as smelling "earthy" and "complicated". A great stocking stuffer at only $10 a bottle.

\[caption id="attachment\_17811" align="alignright" width="150"\][![Mastodon "Black Blood" from Dark Matter Coffee](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mastodon2-render_dd9f8887-c486-4d51-8c70-95847b5d48be_large-150x150.png)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mastodon2-render_dd9f8887-c486-4d51-8c70-95847b5d48be_large.png) Mastodon "Black Blood" from Dark Matter Coffee\[/caption\]

**3\. Mastodon Coffee**

From the geniuses at [Dark Matter Coffee](http://www.darkmattercoffee.com/) comes this limited release run of Mastodon inspired whole bean coffee. It's an espresso based roast that's aged in real Bourbon barrels and comes in a package that beautifully showcases the artwork from Mastodon's latest release "Once More Around the Sun." With only 3000 packages made, it's a gift that's thoughtful, functional and really freaking cool. (_The ["Doom Chuggy" collaboration with Thrill Jockey Records](http://www.darkmattercoffee.com/collections/music-art-collaborations/products/doom-chuggy-limited-release) also looks pretty cool, and comes with a CD or cassette mixtape — Ed._)

**Century Media** is a reliable standby for your essential heavy metal xmas gear. They're even kind enough to gather it all together for you in a special ["Christmas Essentials" Holiday list](http://www.cmdistro.com/Genre/Holiday). This year's highlights include the ["I Heart Black Metal" tree ornament](http://www.cmdistro.com/Item/Century_Media_-_I_Heart_Black_Metal_Christmas_Ornament_-Black-/39703), the [Inverted Cross Embroidered Scarf](http://www.cmdistro.com/Item/Century_Media_-_Inverted_Cross_Embroidered_Scarf/47206), and the [limited release "Keepin' It Warm snow globe](http://www.cmdistro.com/Item/Century_Media_-_Keepin_It_Warm_-_Snow_Globe_-PRE-ORDER-/48190#.VHaCRevOW-U), limited to 500 hand-numbered pieces ("shake it up to see the fire and ash circle around this burning church surrounded by black fencing and tombstones").

As Renee suggested, Etsy is a great place to find some unusual metal gifts. Here are a few items that caught my eye: [Thrash and Shred Rings](https://www.etsy.com/listing/198116756/thrash-and-shred-rings-heavy-metal-death?ref=sr_gallery_2&ga_search_query=heavy+metal&ga_page=2&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery), the [Cattle Decapitation Pillow](https://www.etsy.com/listing/182525597/cattle-decapitation-pillow-3-diy-death?ref=sr_gallery_5&ga_search_query=death+metal&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery), the [Black Metal Piggy Bank](https://www.etsy.com/listing/209926433/black-metal-corpse-paint-ceramic-piggy?ref=sr_gallery_27&ga_search_query=death+metal&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery), and (how could I resist?) the [My Cat Listens to Metal Sweatshirt.](https://www.etsy.com/listing/156080858/my-cat-listens-to-metal-sweatshirt?ref=sr_gallery_9&ga_search_query=death+metal&ga_page=5&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery)

It's an [Emperor-inspired "Ginger Metal Sweatshirt" from the Foo Fighters in your choice of red or green](http://shop.foofighters.com/collections/featured/products/ginger-metal-sweatshirt-cardinal). What more could be said?
