Not too familiar with this Portland outfit, but **Atriarch** have been described as a head-on collision between post-sludge and new wave, which seemed intriguing enough for me to listen up.  The fact that heavy-rock luminaries Billy Anderson and Brad Boatright had a hand in mixing and mastering is also a good sign; the production really gives the songs a big boost, as a certain new-wave aficionado might say. ;)

Oddly enough, “Entropy” starts off with some eerie chants over what might be a sitar or even a didgeridoo, intercut with evil whispers uncharacteristic of either genre.  That said, there is certainly a shade of Neurosis in the tribal drumbeats as the languid, longing vocals take on a more gothic dimension.  We’re about halfway through this track before we get that first riff, and it’s not exactly NeurIsis material.  Don’t listen to much post-goth stuff, but think (insert Bauhaus reference here) or something.

“Collapse” is somewhat more akin to _Through Silver in Blood_, but there aren’t too many tempo changes to be heard here, as it’s more of a steady clamour.  We definitely get some doomy downstrokes atop the military-style drumbeat on “Revenant” before they take things further down to death-doom territory a la Coffins.  After an opening black-metal barrage, “Bereavement” marches along a similarly slow and downtrodden path, before picking things back up in a fashion much akin to Inter Arma.

Never thought I’d say this, but after listening to their Relapse Records debut, Atriarch’s early work might not be new wave _enough_ for me…
