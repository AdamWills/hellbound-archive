Just looking at the publicity for the splendidly named **Laugh At The Fakes**, I see them being recommended for fans of such bands as Opeth (no, Opeth sound like Goblin these days, and that works well for them, but I don’t hear that here), Avenged Sevenfold (urgghh, no, a band that boast about their ‘real estate deals’, whatever they are, F.O.A.D).

No, what I hear is very much in the vein of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, and that is an utter compliment, as the NWOBHM produced so much inspirational music in a short period of time, for instance, Angel’s Witch’ s staggering self-titled debut – Laugh At The Fakes have a real "Sweet Danger" vibe about them – excellent. The NWOBHM also produced such gems as Scotland’s Holocaust with "The Small Hours," Iron Maiden, Diamond Head (without "Am I Evil" where would be we?), Saxon, Blitzkrieg, Satan, and many more. Canada’s Cauldron are a modern version of the these fine bands, taking inspiration and doing their own thing, and Laugh At The Fakes are very much doing the same kind of thing.

Everett Mason has a fantastically melodic voice, and plays a mean riff too, Galen Weir's bass playing deserves mention too, very much in the Jason Newsted/Steve Harris vein, which is as it should be. There is also a pleasing thrash metal influence, which is appropriate, as the thrash movement got a lot of inspiration from the NWOBHM (Venom, Diamond Head, Tank and more).

Overall, Laugh At The Fakes have got great songs, great chops, and a great sound of their own, superb production too. Awesome, and they deserve to be heard! Loudly!
