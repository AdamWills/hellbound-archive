Had not heard from this post-metal outfit, **Giant Squid**, in a little bit—it had been three years since their last EP, and a couple more since they put out an album.  But the West Coast quintet is back with an album that, at least by its title and some of the song names, seems to suggest an allegiance with Ancient Greece.

The title track kicks this one off, the longest song on here at eight-and-a-half minutes.  After a cooing, soothing intro, we’re led down a winding pathway by some symphonic synths and cello passages.  This song sorta has the same laid-back, rootsy vibe as more-recent Earth, until the band finally drops the heavy riffs on us like a Spartan offensive.  But there’s a swirling, soaring element to this track that suggests that while heavy, it’s also still humble.

The same swirling vibe begins “Thera,” although this time, the full band wastes no time in coming in with a nautical barrage.  “Sir Arthur Evans” has a bit of a gruff Scott Kelly solo sound, particularly in the vocal department.  “Sixty Foot Waves” isn’t as intimidating as the song-title suggests, a mellower number that’s no more heavy than, say, Ides of Gemini, while “Mycenaeans” is actually downright soothing with its mellow vocal and cello-driven verse—although, like a couple of its predecessors, it ends on a heavier note.

Overall, it’s a pretty decent mix of colour and textures that would appeal to fans of Earth, Across Tundras, USX et al, though it lands a little on the lighter side.
