Last night the latest round of Wacken Metal Battle Canada had Toronto area bands Our Covenant, Operus, Protokult, The Fiction In Folklore and Endemise duking it out for the chance to move on to the next stage of the competition.

A heck of a lot of bands are competing this year, with multiple rounds scheduled across the country — in Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary as well as Toronto. Clearly, it would be a bit of a challenge to witness every stage of the process and partake of all this heavy Canadian music in person, but you can at least get a taste of the range of metal sounds involved.
