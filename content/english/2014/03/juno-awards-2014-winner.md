Well, the Juno Awards have come, and Hellbounders and Canadian metalheads have been keeping an eye on the new-ish "Metal/Hard Music Album of the Year" category. The committee in charge has been rather successful at embracing underground metal - previous winners include KEN mode and Woods of Ypres.

Nominees for this year's award were:

Heart of Oak – **Anciients** (Season of Mist) ([Listen/Purcahse](http://anciientriffs.bandcamp.com/) | [Hellbound’s Review](http://www.hellbound.ca/2013/03/anciients-heart-of-oak/)) Colored Sands  - **Gorguts** (Season of Mist) ([Listen/Purchase](http://gorguts.bandcamp.com/)) Entrench  - **KEN Mode** (New Damage) ([Listen/Purchase](http://kenmode.bandcamp.com/album/entrench) | [Hellbound’s Review](http://www.hellbound.ca/2013/03/ken-mode-entrench/)) Volition – **Protest the Hero** (Protest) ([Listen/Purchase](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppwWGTgGMMQ&list=PLqWpe8Z5-neDB4A1xK3_mDMTnIz38SUlQ&feature=c4-overview-vl)) Dead Language – **The Flatliners** (New Damage) ([Listen](http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/album_premiere_the_flatliners_dead_language))

Hellbound approved of 3 of the 5 albums in our [Top 10 Canadian Albums of 2013](http://www.hellbound.ca/2014/01/hellbounds-top-10-canadian-metal-albums-of-2013/), but were we in line with what the judges thought?

Apparently not.

## Protest the Hero - Volition

Congratulations to  Protest the Hero on their victory! Interestingly enough, this was the band's first album not released through a label - instead, it was [crowd-funded through Indiegogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/protest-the-hero-new-album--3) (extremely successfully, as well).

Who did you think was most deserving this year? [Let us know in the comments below](#disqus_thread)!
