This review is quite long. But then, **Maryland Deathfest** was a long festival. It was full of bands I wanted to see. I also remained sober through the entire festival. This meant a few things: I saved money for the massive amount of merch that was available. I didn’t wake up each morning feeling like dog shit. And most importantly, I remember every moment of this spectacular music festival. And that’s good – because I did my damnedest to watch every band I wanted to watch! So here are my thoughts on every performance I was able to see at Maryland Deathfest 2014.

## Wednesday – it begins

The first thing I thought when I saw **Noisem** on stage was “Wow, these guys are children.” And yeah, they are teenagers actually. But as I watched their first song their ages really stopped mattering because of how tight they were as a band. Vocalist Tyler Carnes was all over the place, pacing back and forth on stage, moshing in the pit (while growling), and climbing all over the balcony. Meanwhile, his band of teenage death metal miscreants shred out music they’re way too young to be able to play this good. Color me impressed – I can see exactly why this local band isn’t just some “local band.”

Seattle, Washington’s **Black Breath** certainly didn’t disappoint. They are Seattle-by-way-of-Stockholm, Sweden, but with a touch of American rock n’ roll. Their old school death metal sound was punctuated by more than one bluesy solo and groovy hook and I found myself head-banging voraciously and making my first impulse merchandise purchase of the festival: a Black Breath baseball t-shirt. Well done, chaps!

**Misery Index** are also kind of a local band for Maryland Deathfest, but are far more established than their teenage counterparts in Noisem. Misery Index is a death/grind band that features the current drummer of Pig Destroyer and a former founding member of Dying Fetus. I’m not a huge fan, but I know a pro band when I see one on stage, and Misery Index had more than several dozen loyal followers head-banging along savagely. My one complaint from this band is their drummer has way too many splash cymbals. He has three of them and they would pop up on the off-beats of just about every song. Once I recognized that I couldn’t un-hear it and I kept hearing it over and over through their set.

**Immolation** were the headliners of the first night. While the entire Deathfest bill was lined to the brim with amazing talent old and new, Immolation are a band that will continue to outclass just about all of it. That’s high praise, I know, but in my opinion it’s totally true. This is a band that has cut its teeth on the live performance nonstop for 20 plus years and you can tell. No notes are out of place. Ross Dolan is one of the nicest guys in death metal on and off-stage. Bob Vigna headbands and slings his guitar around so viciously I was convinced he was going to hit me in the head with the headstock several times. Their set list focused heavily on newer material, which isn’t that bad a deal considering their newer material is still very strong. But the crowd definitely reacted to a few older cuts thrown in for good measure, particularly “Into Everlasting Fire,” which was taken from their first album.

## Thursday – we all miss Triptykon

When Tom G. Warrior decided he needed to cancel **Triptykon**’s performance, it made me far less excited for this day of the festival. Warrior’s reasons for cancellation were understandable, but I was still quite disappointed.

I got into the Ram’s Head venue in time to see **Sourvein** take the stage. Sourvein’s vocalist, T-Roy (Troy Medlin) doesn’t have the look of a metal vocalist, nor the clothes, but he has the voice, I guess. Sourvein are an okay band, but out of bands of their style I still prefer Eyehategod. They are one of the bands from the American south that forged the grungy, slimy blues-tinged sludge doom style from the mid-90s. They were decently heavy, but I didn’t find myself enjoying their set as much as others.

**Torche** played next. And they were by far one of the most disappointing bands of the whole festival to me. I guess I just don’t understand them. They seemed to have some fans here and there within this crowd, but just didn’t seem to fit. That, and guitarist/vocalist Steve Brooks had some TERRIBLE feedback issues with his guitar/amp/pedals. It wasn’t the kind of feedback you want. It was a piercing, high-pitched squeal that happened every time his guitar wasn’t playing. He was visibly getting more and more upset every time it happened, but I give the guy credit for pushing through and giving the people a full set.

For all the lack of anticipation I had for Torche, I was stoked to the brim for **Coffins**. I love doom metal. This festival brought some amazing doom metal to the United States and Coffins are toward the top of the heap in my opinion. With all that anticipation, and Coffins being the only band of this night I was truly excited for, I wondered whether they match my expectations. They did, kind of. They sounded tight and heavy, and had a great set list of material old and new. But vocalist Jun Tokita seemed a bit tired on stage, and the rest of the band had a similar lack of vitality that could perhaps be explained by a long trip from Japan, their home base. Regardless, the sound didn’t really suffer at all. They crushed, and were an extremely heavy addition to this festival. Plus, they had so many rabid fans in the pit that had never seen them live that I acquired several scratches and bruises during the set (just a few of many through the rest of the fest!).

I’ve seen **Crowbar** before and it was getting late, so I watched a few of their songs and left early. But I can say this: I didn’t leave because I was watching a bad performance. Crowbar sounded amazing. The guitars were crisp and lively and had a great amount of harmony for a band of this style. And Kirk’s voice was equally loud and aggressive. I just needed the rest for the next three days to come. On a side note, there has been enough written about the incident of the fan coming on stage with Crowbar and Kirk Windstein getting “tackled” by a fan. I’ll admit that I didn’t see it.

My review of Thursday is cut short by the fact that I didn’t attend much of it. I was visiting with a non-metal friend of mine who lives in northern Virginia.

## Friday – the day of no rest

The Edison Lot features some of the higher profile and most anticipated bands of Maryland Deathfest for fans of death, black, thrash, and doom metal. And Friday’s lineup was probably the most stacked for my tastes. This day had no breaks: I was deadest on watching all bands’ sets in full. And that’s what I did.

I arrived to the Edison lot just in time to get a good spot for **Mgla**’s set. I had purchased their whole discography on intuition that they’d appear at MDF one day and that intuition paid off. Those purchases paid off too, because I love this band. And they were to become one of many amazing sets I saw at MDF 2014. Somehow Mgla managed to wear leather jackets and black hoods on stage in the blazing summer heat – their black metal had atmosphere, tempo changes, and true dynamics. They are certainly not a blasting, machine gun black metal band. The subtle flourishes that make them so captivating on their recordings were done perfectly live. They were great, and I found my fists perpetually in the air for their set.

A quick walk over and it was time to see **Ruins of Beverast**. This is a band I never ever thought I’d see live. For one, it’s a one-man project. Secondly, I thought Ruins was just a bit too obscure, a bit too underground for this festival. But here they were. And holy shit, they were heavy. I always thought they were a slow, plodding black metal band. But I’ve seen them described as death-doom by others. I can see why they are associated with doom metal now. That slowness becomes almost dirge-like as vocalist and bandleader Alexander von Meilenwald spits forth his vitriolic hate along with the churning miasma of the music behind him. The dude looks possessed when he’s growling – he’s so fucking angry! Their set closer was also the only disappointment to my ears. They went into the opening chords of “I Raised This Stone as a Ghastly Memorial,” from _Foulest Semen of a Sheltered Elite_ to the delight of many a fan. That song has some truly epic clean vocals that were just not well executed on stage. For all the majesty they have on CD, Meilenwald and his band couldn’t give those vocals the weight they needed live. It’s still a very heavy song and I loved hearing it – that was just their only flaw in an otherwise awesome set.

Being the doom fan I am, I was anticipating **Necros Christos** probably more than even Coffins. I’ve spun the shit out of their two albums, _Triune Impurity Rites_ and _Doom of the Occult_. They opened with one of my favorite songs, “Tormented Flesh Upon the Mount of Crucifixion.” What a crusher! Since I had worn out their albums, I was head-banging and air-guitaring like a lunatic. But when I took a break from looking like an idiot, I noticed that for a band that seems to drench its lyrics in mysticism, they are extremely average-looking dudes. For a band called Necros Christos, they just look like Nick and Chris from your old high school. Still, they were fucking top-notch.

It was **Solstafir**, band of Icelandic heathens, which gave me my first surprise of the fest. I was unfamiliar with their material but I was told not to miss them. So I watched them not knowing a note of their music. I walked away with in awe. They were completely unlike any other band at the festival. Solstafir’s members dress like cowboys: vocalist Aðalbjörn Tryggvason has a big hat, big boots and aviator sunglasses on. His crooning, melancholy voice is what sold this band to me. They’re the act that surprised me the most, because of how good they were compared to how little I knew about them coming into this fest.

**Taake** is another one-man band with a live lineup. While there are few consensus picks for “best band of the festival,” Taake seemed to be on many people’s lists when talking to folks after the show. They blew everyone away. Main member Hoest came out dressed in a cartoonish cape and hood, with corpse paint that somehow made him look a bit like the Phantom of the Opera. Goofy stage makeup aside, the band was just simply stunning. Every riff came through, and Hoest’s bandmates brought their own energy. Through it all Hoest himself brought the charisma needed to bring this set together. I was in awe of them during several moments of their set. I snapped a few good pictures, but otherwise I was enchanted by just how fucking good they were. I daresay they could convince even the most diehard death metal fan to at least appreciate what black metal can be all about.

I watched **Cancer**’s set from the back of the pit because I needed a breather. I’m not too familiar with their material, although I know how legendary their albums are, particularly Death Shall Rise. What I can say is that they were very good, and a worthy addition to the festival. Their sound is very typical and solid old school death metal.

I saved my energy for **Agalloch**, a band for which I am a self-professed fanboy. I’ve been nigh on obsessed with this band since _The Mantle_ was still fresh. I often can’t decide which of their albums is my favorite. This year marks the release of their newest album, _The Serpent and the Sphere_. And while a new Agalloch album is definitely something to be excited about, it being released just a week before the festival means that I wasn’t too terribly familiar with it. Still, the band played four of their songs from the new album, which was a little disappointing. In fact, they played no older material at all. I can see this as a positive if I had properly let their new material take shape in my mind. But being unfamiliar with about half their set made me a bit dismayed. Also, the bass was way too loud during their set, which meant that my favorite band had some of the worst sound of the entire festival. I can only hope I can catch them on tour and that these issues will be rectified. I’m lucky to have seen them twice prior (once at MDF, and another in Omaha, Nebraska). What I can say is this: as such a big fan, if this was the first time I had seen them I would have been very disappointed. Regardless, they performed well and brought a great amount of energy. I was just a bit let down.

I also had a large amount of anticipation for **At the Gates**. Here is a band that helped me get into metal. They had already broken up by the time I decided to become mental over _Slaughter of the Soul_. Their reunion in 2008 only oiled the machine for me. I had to see them live. I had to wait until MDF 2014 for that to happen. Other than a few technical hiccups with an amp early in their set, they were flawless. At the Gates played mostly from the SotS album, to the delight of the fans. But when they played even older material, the pit went absolutely bananas. This was by far the most brutal pit to be in so far. I think it’s due to the popularity of the band and the fast pace of all the songs. I tried to hold my own, but it being so late I had to step out of the pit. I got no pictures of At the Gates because the crowd was so crazy around me. Their set was energetic as all hell, and Tomas Lindberg is just a great front man. I’m so glad to scratch this band off my bucket list, finally.

I walked to the Baltimore Soundstage for **Impaled**, and what would be the most insane set I’d see at the festival. If all the sets at the Soundstage are as crazy as what I saw in there that night, I’d leave MDF beaten and severely injured. As it stands, I could probably only handle it for one band. The Soundstage features most of the hardcore, punk, crust, and grindcore bands that MDF can amass. That’s not usually my scene, but I love Impaled so I had to see them again. And they performed their entire first album with Leon del Muerte on lead vocals, which is a pretty awesome thing for this band to do. Performance-wise, Impaled was great. They were extremely tight, well rehearsed, and very funny on stage. Their performance belied the insanity on and off stage. There were stage-divers left and right. There was an insane circle pit going on at all times. There were crowd surfers simultaneous to the stage divers. There were blow-up dolls and glow sticks everywhere. The ballyhooed MDF Party Brigade was in full swing. And in the face of all this insanity, Impaled played on flawlessly, dodging everyone who dared go on stage.

Because of how insane it was during their set, I could only stay awake for a few songs of **Incantation**. What I saw sounded phenomenal, but I had to call it a night. My body was too wrecked to handle more. Besides, there was still two more long days of metal to go.

## Saturday – keeping it old school

I skipped **Goat Torment** to have a late lunch. My belly thanked me, but plenty of my friends said they were quite good. But black metal in the hot summer sun is a weird entity unto itself. Regardless, Diocletian was up next and I really wanted to see their brand of war metal on the stage.

In a similar vein to bands like Conqueror or Canada’s Revenge, **Diocletian** pummels you in the face with a spiked iron fist. They are one of the most hateful bands I’ve ever seen on stage. Vocalist Atrociter distorts his face with so much anger and hatred; I had to try to capture it on camera (I did my best). Regardless, their set was a constant barrage with little variance, but it was still aggressive enough to keep me smiling even during the parts where I couldn’t find much of a rhythm to bang my head with. I enjoyed their set, but I think they are better off enjoyed indoors.

**Entrails** proved to be just the thing I needed to set my palate for some solid Swedish death metal. These guys know their shit. Yet another vocalist who is able to double as an instrument impressed me. They were extremely heavy, but not very technical, which is what you want in that old school gory death metal sound. The whole time they were playing, there was a drunken dude (how the fuck are you that drunk at 2:30pm?) yelling “BLOOD HAMMER! BLOOOOD HAMMERRRR!!!” Vocalist/bassist Jocke Svensson finally gave into this demand and went into “Bloodhammer,” and now I realize why the drunken dude wanted it so bad. Fuck yeah, that song rules

I skipped **Machetazo** to the dismay of my friends. They say they ruled, but I needed more food and water. My body was drained. The sunshine and long days on my feet were getting to me. I got a bit more strength and found a spot near the front for **God Macabre**, a band that many were anticipating highly due to their old school cred. God Macabre released one album back in the 90s and called it quits. This is usually hit or miss on the stage, as bands that take big breaks sometimes can’t keep the magic alive on stage. God Macabre did not disappoint. They were fucking heavy as hell. Entrails, meet your makers. The good news is that God Macabre’s long-lost album is being re-released and the band will have a new album soon.

As amped as the crowd was for Swedish metal, an American band came was the subject of high hopes for many. I slunk away early from God Macabre to make sure I was front and center for **Nocturnus A.D**. This isn’t Nocturnus, but rather Mike Browning And Friends. Still – it’s Nocturnus – The Key in its entirety. In a few words, it was fucking incredible. There were live keyboards, Mike on vocals and drums, and flawless guitar. The coup-de-grace was at the end. Mike fuckin’ Browning, founding member of Morbid fuckin’ Angel, did drums and vocals for “Chapel Of Ghouls.” That was one of those live moments I will literally never forget. The band had a hiccup in the middle and just decided to regroup and try the whole song again. And it was great. By the middle of it the second time around, you couldn’t even hear Mike singing any more. The entire crowd almost in unison was chanting along – “SATAN! IN THE FIRES OF HELL AWAITS!”

The day went on, and it then was time for some old school thrash metal. I did not watch **Tankard** from the front. But I did do a little moshing. Just a little. I felt it necessary, considering that this is a band that totally doesn’t take themselves seriously. Gerre slaps himself in his beer belly with the microphone, dances with women from the crowd on stage, and drinks copious amounts of beer during the show. This was one of the most fun sets of the entire fest, and even someone that wasn’t drinking at all (me) was singing, “I want some BEER! I want some WHISKEY!” at the very end. Awesome.

If Tankard didn’t take themselves seriously at all, **Sacrifice** did. Both bands are thrash; both bands are quite different in their approach. Since I was pretty worn out from Tankard, I watched most of Sacrifice from the back. But they had some of the best guitar tone I’ve ever heard and sounded technically amazing. We are very lucky this band has gotten back together, because there needs to be more good technical thrash bands around. It ain’t always about partying hard, boys and girls.

As the sun dipped behind some clouds low on the horizon, it was time for a big mood change at Maryland Deathfest 2014. Norway’s **Sarke** were another oddball for the fest. They have black metal cred, featuring members of Borknagar and the almighty Darkthrone, but they’re more of a melancholy hard rock band. When Ted Skjellum (a.k.a. Nocturno Culto) shyly walked on stage, the whole crowd erupted in cheers. The man was revered by just about all among that crowd. But despite his credentials, Nocturno Culto is not a very experienced front man. He seemed reserved, almost distracted. He seemed aloof, which fits his persona. At times he would take his cell phone out and just snap photos of his band, while in the middle of a song. But his voice sounded awesome. Seriously, the man fit the bill for this band, yet he even admitted on stage that he isn’t much of a showman. Regardless, Nocturno led another moment that will go down in history for MDF. He grabbed a guitar and proclaimed to the crowd they were about to do two covers. He simply dedicated the first one to “Tom and Giger,” and Sarke went into “Dethroned Emperor.”   The place erupted. A previously stoic crowd just went insane for the Celtic Frost cover, delivered by one of their lords and saviors. But it was their closer that got an even crazier response. Nocturno Culto, standing in front of a North American crowd for the first time, announced “Too Old, Too Cold,” and you’d have thought Darkthrone was on stage for these people. It was, to repeat myself from a previous (and quite recent) experience, magical.

And yet, the day wasn’t over. A long-lost friend of mine made it to the fest just in time to see a band from his childhood. I joined him on the backside of the pit to witness a band that in my opinion all these kids playing “old school death metal” need to bend their knee to. Johnny Hedlund is one of the undisputed kings of the death metal growl. And boy did **Unleashed** deliver their death metal on a cold concrete slab right in the faces of all who witnessed. But what Unleashed gave us those other death metal bands failed to give us was a fucking show. Johnny has every bit of charisma that you’d want from a band that just churns out classic riff after classic riff. By the end everyone was fist-pumping and singing along. It was madness, and I’m glad I got to see it from behind the violence. Unleashed definitely deserve their spot in the immortal pantheon of metal.

This next bit makes me deserve a swift kick in the nuts. But it was a decision I procrastinated until the very last minute. **Dark Angel** have been one of my favorite thrash metal bands for years. And they’ve long been broken up, so I just never imagined they’d return. Regardless, Switzerland’s **Bolze**r put out one of the best EPs I’ve heard, like ever, with 2013’s Aura. It’s so unique, such a breath of fresh air, that the festival organizers putting them up against Dark Angel was a travesty. But right at the zero hour, I decided to ditch the Edison Lot and get in the midst of the Ram’s Head for Bolzer. And to this very moment, I still don’t know if I made the right decision. Don’t get me wrong, I was ecstatic to see Bolzer, and they played all of Aura. Yet, KzR – for whatever reason – was suffering from the EXACT SAME feedback problems that Steve from Torche was having. And this is a band that relies heavily on dynamic changes and tempo shifts and ambiance within the aggression. There is nuance to the sound that Bolzer creates. And it was all lost when that high-pitched feedback just washed everything out. KzR was so visibly frustrated with the sound that he cut his band’s set short by two songs and they left the stage. So, I missed a headlining set of a band I love to see 20 minutes of another band I love. I still bought a ton of Bolzer’s merch and told them that I really hope they come back to the States for a proper set because, goddamn, there’s so much potential there.

The other thing that missing Dark Angel let me do was watch all of **Hooded Menace** from the front. And this band brought the doom. They had no feedback issues whatsoever; they just crushed skulls left and right. They had great old-school guitar tone, great riffs, and low-end growls. Yep, Hooded Menace snarled in the very face of the mainstream. There was nothing to be disappointed about here.

But that was just an appetizer for another band that are considered one of the best of the festival by many. By the time **Asphyx** were setting up, anyone who had been pummeled by Dark Angel had made their way to the sold out Ram’s Head. And from note one, the mosh pit was insane. The Ram’s Head security had no idea how to handle the barrage. The crowd was nuts. There were people smashing into me left and right. Yet, through it all, Martin van Drunen and crew were absolutely killing it on stage. Old material and new, it didn’t matter. There might have been new dogs playing with old tricks at MDF, but Asphyx are the old dogs – and they are your grand masters of that slow death metal. Regardless, as exhausted as I was, staying awake for Asphyx was totally worth it. And once my head hit the pillow that night I was asleep instantly, with ears still ringing.

## **Sunday – Maryland doom fest**

I had already seen some good doom metal since I’d arrived in Baltimore. I saw Sourvein, I saw Coffins, Necros Christos, Hooded Menace, and Asphyx. But Sunday was the day for doom legends to rise from their wormy graves. But the Day of Doom began with a few bong hits (figuratively for me, although there was plenty of casual smoking in the outdoor venues).

**Windhand** are a relatively new band, but one I was somewhat familiar with already. What I didn’t know from their recordings was that their vocalist was a female. Regardless, Dorthia Cottrell was meant for the stage. Her voice rose above the riffs and provided an almost panicked wail with a sense of melody that I hadn’t heard from just the recordings alone. I have to say that Windhand was already a band I enjoyed, but seeing them live was an even more enjoyable experience. And I give the credit to Cottrell.

As good as Windhand was, **Bongripper** was the first “Holy shit!” moment of this day. They were incredibly loud. Their sound permeated my bones. And they were captivating from the first note on. There is no vocalist in this band. There are only riffs: sweet, tasty, groovy doom metal riffs. Anyone and everyone who was near the stage had to stop and listen, dumbfounded by the spectacle on stage: four guys creating some of the most massive guitar tone any of us had ever heard. At the end of their set, after bludgeoning the crowd with their thunderous cacophony, one of their guitarists was just eking out the last bit of feedback from his guitar amp. He just let the guitar fall to the floor, the guitar snapped into two pieces, neck separating from the body. He was heard after their set saying, “that’s why I buy cheap guitars and good amps.” If you missed Bongripper, you missed something special. Yet, that seems to be a repeatable theme at Maryland Deathfest.

I skipped **Graves at Sea** and **Misery Index** because the sun was getting to me again. I needed water, and I needed barbecue. I found both at Zombie Barbecue, where I loaded my sandwich with extra spicy “Fuck Sauce.” The proprietor gave me extra water for free. This was crucial, given that there was no free water anywhere else and that sunshine was seemingly endless.

To deviate from the doom, it was time for some more devil worship. Russia’s **Pseudogod** got those festivities started with a bloody bang. And by bloody, I mean literally bloody. The band looked like they had cut each other up before their performance as they were all caked with blood, sweat, and whatever else. Plus, vocalist I.S.K.H. had a pretty sizable inverted cross rosary gleaming in the summer sun. Regardless, their brand of black metal reminded me of Black Witchery with just a bit more going on in the riffs. Indeed that comparison seems even more àpropos considering Black Witchery’s Impurath was playing bass on the live stage. It worked well, but I thought their getup was a bit silly for the sunshine and I was worried for their health.

I really like Chile’s **Wrathprayer** on their album _The Sun of Moloch: The Sumblimation of Sulphur’s Essence Which Spawned Death and Life._ However, after the barrage of sound from Pseudogod, their sound was a bit too similar to hold my interest for very long. They didn’t sound bad, but I needed to conserve my energy (and consume more cold water!).

I attended the **My Dying Bride** signing session and met one of my musical heroes, Aaron Stainthorpe. There were some MDB super fans in this line, some of whom seemed to have brought every MDB recording ever. I had them sign the most recent album and my favorite of theirs, _Turn Loose the Swans_.

As I walked away from the signing session, it was time to see one of my favorite black metal bands, **Inquisition**. They blew me away when I saw them at this very same festival a few years ago. And since then, I’ve had the chance to see them live a few more times. And every time, the two-piece has never disappointed. This was no exception. They played an almost identical set to the one I saw on tour with Behemoth. Regardless, it was flawlessly executed and extremely heavy. Guitarist/vocalist Dagon becomes his guitar as the fullness of his chords is heard through the rumble of drums behind him. I am in awe of a man who can command such a full sound all by himself. That is the mastery that is Inquisition. Any who were seeing them for the first time had to have been as impressed as I was my first time. They were still that good.

Ben Falgoust of **Soilent Green** told me it’s been three years since the band played live. He told me he littered the front of the stage with lyrics so he wouldn’t forget them. You can’t blame him; he’s made his bread by being a road warrior for sludgy black metallers Goatwhore. Yet, it is the former band that graced the Maryland Deathfest stage, and I must say that they did not disappoint either. The bluesiness in their riffs was there. The groove was massive. And there might have been a little pot smoke floating around as well. Welcome back to the stage, Soilent Green.

My anticipation was high for **Gorguts**. I had managed to miss them during their first stab at a reunion and subsequent tours. I have never seen them live. Their new album, _Colored Sands_, is every bit as good a reunion album as there ever was. And even though the band is now Luc Lemay and Pals, they were phenomenal. No notes were out of place, Luc’s voice sounded killer, and their brand of jazzy tech-death won over everyone watching. For only having about 45 minutes to play, they definitely played a good mix of old and new. I was very pleased to finally see the band do their thing.

And as the sun began to set on the final day of Maryland Doomfest, the doomed rose again. **Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats** made their first American appearance. I didn’t know how they’d be. Their vocal approach is so unique, that I had my doubts on how well they’d execute live. They were the second “Holy shit!” moment of the day. Maybe the pot smoke around me was getting to me, maybe it was the sunset behind the band, maybe it was the sweet blues solos emanating off the guitars, I don’t know. Uncle Acid nailed it. And the vocals were beautiful. They couldn’t have been more different from Gorguts. It was like I was watching an old blues band do their thing on the MDF stage. But it had just enough of a metal attitude that it fit perfectly. And even though they confused the hardcore moshers in the pit, everyone else seemed mesmerized by the sound on stage. I already liked what I had heard from this band. Now I am a full-on acolyte to the Church of Uncle Acid.

Yet, as awesome as the day had been, it was time for the headliners to show everyone how it’s done. **Candlemass** needs no introduction. But maybe their singer does. Mats Leven is kind of a hired hand among Swedish melodic metal bands. He’s done vocals for Therion, At Vance, Amassefer, Yngwie Malmsteen, and a plethora of others. But Candlemass is probably his most high-profile gig. And even though I thought Candlemass was awesome, Mats did get mixed reviews from some of my friends. I had never seen them live, so I was going to love it regardless. Maybe I was too busy singing “Bewitched” and “Mirror Mirror” at the top of my lungs to notice, but I thought Mr. Leven did a fine job. And he had all the standard rock n’ roll stage poses to make him a more than formidable front man.

**My Dying Bride** is a completely different entity. While still doom metal, they take away all that rock ‘n’ roll bounce and replace it with a sense of sincerity and gravity that I doubt the festival had seen up to the point. My Dying Bride were captivating. While other bands brought raw energy, or hatred, or anger, My Dying Bride brought subtlety and true emotion. Aaron Stainthorpe is not a leather-clad hard rocker. He is a brooding, serious individual who puts his bleeding heart on the stage for all to see. And he hadn’t done it for an American audience in 18 years. He apologized, and promised that they would be sooner than 18 years from now. My favorite part of their performance was that when they were being soft and quiet, an otherwise rowdy crowd was actually attentive and gave them the silence needed for those musical nuances to be appreciated. Could the main stage of Maryland Deathfest have a better closer? Doubtful. I do know that My Dying Bride wasn’t just icing on the cake. They were having your cake and eating it too.

Yet, the festival wasn’t over. I got to the Ram’s Head in time to enjoy all of **Ulcerate**’s set from very close to the front. I wasn’t that familiar with them, honestly. I knew the name and I knew they were a technical death metal band, but that was about it. But holy shit what a wall of sound! Their riff style is a bit chaotic and tough to follow, but what really impressed me about this band of Kiwis is the drumming. Jamie Saint Merat is now on my radar as a very underrated (or virtually unknown virtuoso) drummer extraordinaire. His intricate drumming was peppered with flourishes on the cymbals that just blew my mind at every moment. I was tired, sure. But Ulcerate were a spectacle. And thankfully, the pit was relatively tame enough that I could enjoy a weird band without much hubbub behind me.

I called it a night after that. Immolation came out to close the fest. I know they probably ruled. But it was time for a good night’s rest and time to call it quits on another amazing Maryland Deathfest. I left with a few cuts and bruises, a huge smile on my face, and a few new shirts and CDs in my luggage to carry home. In closing, the fest was expertly run; with few exceptions the sound was impeccable, and I had one of the best experiences I’ve ever had seeing live music. This was one for the history books.
