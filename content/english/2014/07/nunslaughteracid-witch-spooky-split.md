I love splis releases. A recent favourite would have to be Godreah’s splendid _The Bones_ _of This Land Are Not Speechless/British Black Punk Metal_, from the excellent Old Corpse Road and The Meads of Asphodel respectively (see [www.godreah.com](http://www.godreah.com/)). Wouldn’t it be great to see Mastodon and Voivod do a split? I’d love to hear Mastodon cover Blind Illusion’s "Blood Shower" off _The Sane Asylum_ album – it's tailor made for them.

As you would expect from a label of the calibre of Hells Headbangers, **Acid Witch** and **Nunslaughter** are fine bands and both acquit themselves well on this split in two sides: ‘_Doom’_ and ‘_Death.’_ Each band contributes two tracks, one each per side, which is unusual but works.

Mention must be made of the superb artwork for this split, in the vein of EC Comics – it’s the poster for the best film you’ve never seen.

Well worth picking up a copy of this!
