Kick out the jaaaaams, man!  When **Earthless** axeslinger Isaiah Mitchell suffered a bizarre gardening accident shortly before Roadburn 2012, the band drafted not one but two guitarists to replace him for the occasion.  Enter **J. Mascis** and **Graham Clise**, both of **Witch**, although you probably know the former from **Dinosaur Jr**.  Let’s just say he doesn’t play drums at this gig… which, like so many other Roadburn performances, was recorded for posterity.

Instead, we get an hour-long, dual-guitar jam session that lives up to its name, “Paradise in a Purple Sky.”  This number starts off slowly, as most spontaneous jam-pieces are known to do, but the amalgamated group soon finds its groove, guitars wailing away in stereo over a steady rhythm section.  When it comes to jam-bands, Eginton and Rubalcaba are just about the best in the business nowadays, and when you add two axes well-versed in the psychedelic style, you really can’t go wrong…

Man, after listening to this, I kinda really wanna see that one-off gig they’re playing in Boston in a couple months.  Hey, I heard the headlining band’s not bad, either. ;)
