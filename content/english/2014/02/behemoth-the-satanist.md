**By Danielle Griscti**

As a tenth album, Poland's **Behemoth** offers longtime fans and new listeners _The Satanist_. This collection of nine tracks is both instantly recognizable as the work of these blackened death metal legends, and a new and distinctive entry into their already impressive and worthwhile catalogue. Their 2004 monster _Demigod_ was one of my first forays into the world of blackened death, and on first listen I was veritably crushed by the sheer brutality – which I simply was not musically prepared for. This time around I was again overwhelmed, not by the sonic wall of aggression and characteristic death metal 'crush everything' attitude, but now by a variety of elements layered into the mix.

Feelings of boldness, strength and empowerment dominate the opening tracks, as intro "Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel" calls out a war cry and "Furor Divinis" continues to paint the atmosphere. With "Messe Noire" and "Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer," direct quotations from Catholic prayers begin to make an appearance. For a band known for (dramatically, theatrically and thoroughly entertainingly) tearing up bibles on stage, this should come as no surprise. Opening with a clearly enunciated statement of his purpose – 'I Believe in Satan' – vocalist/guitarist Nergal sets the stage for a black mass in which the climax is a glorious guitar solo.

The use of distinctive elements like the organ, sax, and trumpets, as well as spoken-word chant in both Polish and English, are extremely well incorporated throughout the album. At no point do they detract from the overall feel; the title track does this especially well. At the same time as lyrics like 'Fear I cast aside!' ("Ben Sahar") continue to call out the message of _The Satanist_, I was reminded strongly of the strength and unforgiving aggression of previous albums, exactly what makes me continue to be curious about what Behemoth has come up with.
