Well, the 2014 Juno Award Nominees have been announced, and us Hellbounders were keeping an eye out for the Metal/Hard Music Album of the Year category. Unlike their American counterparts, the Junos have done a great job of having some great acts win and get nominated in the past (Woods of Ypres won in 2013 and KEN Mode won the inaugural award in 2012).

This year's nominees are as follows:

Heart of Oak - **Anciients** (Season of Mist) ([Listen/Purcahse](http://anciientriffs.bandcamp.com/) | [Hellbound's Review](http://www.hellbound.ca/2013/03/anciients-heart-of-oak/)) Colored Sands  - **Gorguts** (Season of Mist) ([Listen/Purchase](http://gorguts.bandcamp.com/)) Entrench  - **KEN Mode** (New Damage) ([Listen/Purchase](http://kenmode.bandcamp.com/album/entrench) | [Hellbound's Review](http://www.hellbound.ca/2013/03/ken-mode-entrench/)) Volition - **Protest the Hero** (Protest) ([Listen/Purchase](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppwWGTgGMMQ&list=PLqWpe8Z5-neDB4A1xK3_mDMTnIz38SUlQ&feature=c4-overview-vl)) Dead Language - **The Flatliners** (New Damage) ([Listen](http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/album_premiere_the_flatliners_dead_language))

Hellbound [agrees on 3 of the albums that made the cut](http://www.hellbound.ca/2014/01/hellbounds-top-10-canadian-metal-albums-of-2013/), but the omission of Voivod seems to a pretty questionable decision.

The Juno Awards will be held on March 30, 2014 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
