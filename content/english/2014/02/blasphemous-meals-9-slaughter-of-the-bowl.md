This entry of Blasphemous Meals . I chose each for their type of protein and method of preparation, which ultimately makes them fitting year round.

For our Toronto readers, I hope each evokes a sense of warmth in contrast to long winter we’re having – straight outta _Battles in the North_.

Salutteeee!

 

## **Amebix Prawn Bisque**

## **By Rob “The Baron” Miller of AMEBIX**

A hearty bowl of soup isn’t just for fall, folks. Carrots, sweet potatoes, garlic, herbs and spices make this bisque a perfect base for a tough, white fish. In this case, I used cod. But I have to be honest – I cheated a bit. (Don’t kill me, Annick!)

Instead of making homemade fish stock, I used fish bouillon. I also didn’t incorporate a seafood mix, but a substitution of black tiger shrimp baked in my own garlic-[togarashi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shichimi) marinade. The result was a warm, buttery skewer with kick. The soup was a perfect blend of root veggies, but I regret not adding some curry powder or chili flakes while it simmered.

This versatile bisque is perfect as an appetizer or a main course. It yields many portions, is easy to freeze and great for last minute dinners.

Pair with a rose wine and multigrain loaf – if you have a choice, grab a bag from [ACE Bakery](http://www.acebakery.com/artisan-bread/product/33/harvest-grain-oval/).

## **Churrasco in Soy Sauce**

## **By Andreas Kisser of SEPULTURA**

Ah, yes. A band from my youth! To this day, _Beneath The Remains_ is an album that really built my confidence in times of high school angst. Although I don’t frequently eat Brazilian/Portuguese food, this dish really inspired me to explore the world of rotating spits and raging flames – churrasqueira!

Churrasco in soy sauce is, really, a simple steak. If you have a spit, it’s essential. If not, just toss on the grill until the meat is cooked to your taste. When it comes to grilled fish or beef, I prefer medium well. This steak needs sufficient time to marinade in soy sauce ([Kikkoman](http://www.kikkomanusa.com/index.html) is best!) before it hits the barbecue with a loud _“TTTTTTZZZZSSSS.”_

Pair with a few oven baked red skin or new potatoes. For a twist, I recommend “smashed” potatoes on a skillet with whole garlic and rosemary.

To drink, try a pint of [Moretti](http://www.birramoretti.com/) or a chilled glass of [Guanabana](http://www.rubiconexotic.com/guanabana).

## **Tomato Chicken Necrocasserole**

## **By Dictator of NECROSADIST**

[![Casserole](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Casserole-590x393.jpg)](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Casserole.jpg)

What the fuck is a casserole? I’ve never understood them. Ever. Yeah, it’s a “layered” dish of meat and carbs, a carnivore’s lasagna of sorts. But really, once everything is mixed together, it’s a blob of ingredients. In this case, Dictator has achieved palatable simplicity.

The tomato chicken “necrocasserole” is a quick weeknight meal that can be paired with a variety of sides. I opted for instant polenta from [Paese Mio](http://salutebrands.com/assets/images/Product%20Pics/Grains%20and%20Flours/import-polenta1.jpg). The chicken breast was tender, while the cornmeal soaked up a tomato base filled with potatoes, onions and seasonings.

Top with a sprig of rosemary or thyme, pair with a glass of Chianti and you’re good to go.
