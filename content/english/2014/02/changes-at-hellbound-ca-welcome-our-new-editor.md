Hey Hellbound readers!

Thanks to all of you who are around and reading our work in 2014. It's hard to believe but we are closing in quickly on our five year anniversary, which will take place June 1st. It's been a fun time cranking out stuff over the past five years, but as of late it's been difficult for me to keep up with everything.

In early November I started a new job outside of the music industry. I now work a warehouse job for a wireless/cellular distributor just outside of Toronto, so I am gone from pretty much 6:45 AM until at least 7:00 PM every weekday. It's a pretty labour intensive job and I found out quickly that my free time on a computer was going to be pretty limited to my lunchtime only. Hence the very sporadic entries on this website for most of the rest of 2013. However, with the advent of the new year, you may have noticed things are moving much more smoothly over here at Hellbound.ca.

You can thank the awesome **[Laura Wiebe](http://www.hellbound.ca/2011/06/hellbound-staff-interrogation-7-laura-wiebe/)** for the upswing in articles as of late on Hellbound. Laura kindly offered to bring her immense talents to the site as editor in late December and has been running the website almost single-handed ever since. Laura has a long history of being involved with metal, both as a journalist and academically, having written for the likes of Exclaim!, Unrestrained! and this site as well as recently completing her PhD at McMaster University.

I am so delighted to have someone as talented and amazing as Laura running the site and feel that this is just going to make Hellbound.ca so much better. Please help welcome Laura to the site and if you want to get in touch with her about all things Hellbound please get in touch with her at killeatexploittheweak@yahoo.ca .

Thanks,

Sean Palmerston Publisher, Hellbound.ca
