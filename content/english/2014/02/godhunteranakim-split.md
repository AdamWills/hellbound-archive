**By Gruesome Greg**

Ten minutes of Arizona sludge brought to you by the fine folks at The Compound.  Godhunter kicks things off with “Vulture’s Wake,” a rough, ragged basement-quality recording that sounds very much in the NOLA vein, complete with Kirk Windstein tough-guy vocals.  Anakim airs things out a little with “The Whimper of Whipped Dogs” showcasing some pretty menacing instrumental post-sludge with shades of Isis.  Who knew there was sludge in the desert, anyways?
