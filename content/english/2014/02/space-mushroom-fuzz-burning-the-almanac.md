**By Gruesome Greg**

Quickie, 20-minute EP from this Boston-based heavy psych outfit—now a proper power trio, apparently. The space-rock theme remains readily apparent in the four song titles, as “The Cosmic Evolution” kicks things off with some heavy fuzz-rock riffage and equally-distorted vocals.

“The Bio Zones” keeps the cosmic grooves going, a nice slow burner that puts a little harsh in yer mellow. “The Suffering” offers a gritty Dave Chandler-style riff beneath airy, spacey vocals, giving off a vaguely Vitus vibe. “The Altered Universe” continues with the swampy garage doom feel, a slight departure from the band’s past two records, but not an unwelcome one.
