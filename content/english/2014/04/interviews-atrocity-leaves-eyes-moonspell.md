**Interviews with Atrocity, Leaves’ Eyes, and Moonspell** **The Riot Room, Kansas City, Missouri, Friday, February 14, 2014**

## Alexander Krull (Atrocity/Leaves' Eyes)

We begin with a conversation with **Alexander Krull** from **Atrocity** and **Leaves’ Eyes**. Most of our discussion was about Atrocity, although since both bands share members it’s difficult to keep them 100 per cent separate. When I told him that the first Atrocity album I listened to was _Hallucinations,_ Krull himself takes a look back to his early years as a musician:

“We were formed in 1985. We were on the exciting foundation of the movement of death metal starting. We were like the first death metal band out of Germany – Morgoth also came along – but there weren’t so many bands around that time.”

Krull readily admits that Atrocity hasn’t always stayed the same. The self-proclaimed perfectionist and workaholic says he would never want the sound to stay the same; it would lose his interest:

“The ambition to invent something, or also challenging ideas to bring into metal that’s not the usual way or the common way, to be exciting, \[are all\] probably why we are still alive after such a long time!  We never get bored of ourselves!”

Atrocity as a band has been technical death metal, they’ve experimented with electronic sounds, with darkwave, with folk metal, and now they’ve forged a death metal sound with quite a bit of orchestration that would be perhaps a happy medium between the dark heaviness of modern SepticFlesh and the classical arrangements of Therion. Therion is an important comparison, because like the approach Therion takes with their albums, Alex Krull says using real choirs and a real orchestra is a huge undertaking:

“Believe me, there’s a lot of effort into it, a lot of 'blood sweat and tears' I think is the right expression. With all the many things we do, we don’t do it as a quick or spontaneous stuff. It’s also for us very important that the quality is of a certain level of course; it has to be professional.”

The conversation then turned to lyrics. _Hallucinations_ features lyrics that aren’t the typical early death metal fare. Instead of zombies and monsters and gore, it tackled some really serious topics like drug abuse, rape, alcoholism, among others. Alex Krull says even nowadays lyrics are a very important part of Atrocity.

“I always had a strong impact \[from\] the dark side of human history and all those things connected to it and less the fantasy part, let’s say. There are so many things going on… or a lot of stories going on that are like the dark side of the coin in the history of mankind. Religion, politics, they use fear to manipulate people and to spread stuff out. And we have some strong examples \[on the _Okkult_ album\], like how the real world is connected to this occult world!”

He then mentions the closing song of the _Okkult_ album, “La Voisine,” a song that takes its lyrics from a story in old Paris. Catherine Monvoisin was a fortune teller, poisoner, and – allegedly – a sorceress (thanks Wikipedia!). Krull’s lyrics go into that story:

“They were doing black masses… she had the head of the richest man in her back yard… they found like 2,500 dead bodies of infants. That’s stuff that was actually happening! And the high society was supporting it – they all knew about it!  They wanted to get strength and power… and when it all came out… she was already dead… executed for the poisoning then they found out the other stories!”

I had to ask Alex about the live setting for both his bands. Leaves’ Eyes and Atrocity have basically the same core members. Thorsten Bauer, who has been on guitars in Atrocity since 1994, plays bass in their live set. Sander van der Meer is on guitar and Joris Nijenhuis handles drums. All of these fellows play those same roles in both Atrocity and Leaves’ Eyes. It saves on travel expenses, sure, but the two bands are not at all the same; so I asked Mr. Krull about how they prepare for two sets in a night:

“It’s just like with the songwriting process. There’s never a question if we’re writing a Leaves’ Eyes or Atrocity song. We know that this belongs to this band and this belongs to another.”

I’ve seen Leaves’ Eyes four times before this show, so I knew a little bit about what to expect. Krull, as a frontman, demands audience participation. He’s into chanting, fist pumping, clapping, and sometimes all of the above all at once. I needed to ask him what inspired this, and I think he surprised himself with the answer:

“I remember very well I saw Iron Maiden in 1984. I really loved the way it was a huge stage set and it was fantastic overall – it was the Powerslave tour!  But although it was so big and so many people there, the band made it so that every visitor was connected to the band and was a part of the show. And when Bruce Dickinson was running around… he was getting people to be as one with the band. And that’s what I also try to do. When I think about me, it’s something I really like, that everyone feels the music and is a part of it.”

Krull says that the _Okkult_ album is part one of a planned trilogy, and after the festival season they will likely start writing for the second part. He doesn’t know when that will be released, but expects it in 2015 at the earliest.

## Liv Kristine (Leaves' Eyes)

**Liv Kristine (Leaves' Eyes)** greeted me with a hug. She’s that kind of gal, I guess. And though she’s a veteran performer who admits she has a few more wrinkles now, she is still quite beautiful in person. And she was wearing a pretty badass Black Sabbath shirt during our interview!

Kristine is the former vocalist for Theatre of Tragedy, and she did indulge a few questions about that former band. But first, a few questions about Leaves’ Eyes, which is now in its eleventh year. She says even though Leaves’ Eyes has done a number of tours in the States, it’s taken far too long to come back:

“We’d probably be able to have done seven tours already if it had worked out as planned. Everything went alright with our visas and all the stuff you have to take care of with the officials to get into the US. Finally it was went all right!”

Liv mentions that she did a tour with Moonspell back in the 1990s. It was a touring package that blew my mind: Theatre of Tragedy, Moonspell, Rotting Christ, and Samael. I had to catch my breath!  But that’s the past and this is now, and Leaves’ Eyes are a veteran band. And it’s a band she’s in with her husband. I was very curious as to how, as Mrs. Alexander Krull, that dynamic worked for a band that’s constantly on the road:

“When I bumped into Alex 20 years ago, I thought ‘Wow this guy is just huge! He has so much energy… he’s a perfectionist, he’s a workaholic, and he just takes care of everything. He could be the chancellor of Germany! He’ll never retire; he’s just amazing. I’m a quieter person, so we kind of complement each other, fulfill each other. Everything he’s not able to do I can do and the other way around. We’ve been married eleven years and I can still, to be honest, say I just love this guy. Even in a situation like this, being \[in a tour bus with 15 guys and our kid\] it’s fine!  It works!”

But I had to ask about Theatre of Tragedy. I told her that _Velvet Darkness They Fear_ is one of my favorite albums of that style, up there with _Widow’s Weeds_ by Tristania. When I’m in the mood for that style, those two always pop up for me. I was less interested in the breakup, but more interested in the music they inspired with that early material:

“We didn’t know back then in the beginning in the mid-'90s what we had started, what we had founded. So when we started we got a deal just eight weeks after we recorded four demo tracks on a cassette. Alex was actually the man who signed Theatre of Tragedy to Massacre Records way back then; he’s the man who made us big. We just started selling records up there in Norway and had no clue what was going on.”

Liv Kristine says the fast success of Theatre of Tragedy and the money, paired with pressure from labels perhaps led to the split.

“Major labels, big deals, that was maybe too fast for a couple of the guys in my band. So when we released _Musique_ and _Assembly_, sales weren’t that great and labels were complaining. If they came out now they’d \[do great because\] that’s in, that’s what’s in now. We were very much ahead of our time. Our audiences wanted us to do what we did on our first three albums. The labels wanted more pop music. So with all this pressure and the sales not going that well, I guess me being in Germany and the rest of the guys in Norway it created a sort of crisis. So they kicked me out. I was 2,000 kilometers away!  And you have nothing to say then. I’m really sad they kicked me out of the band and I really never understood why they did it and the way they did it. But still Leaves’ Eyes came into existence because they kicked me out so I’m still here and we’re going strong, so nothing happens in vain.”

I was impressed by her honesty on that matter, but I knew I had to kick it back to Leaves’ Eyes and keep it positive. She had already mentioned that the female-fronted metal style is in vogue nowadays. I asked her if this has attracted more women to come out to metal shows:

“I see Lita Ford and Doro as forerunners, even though the music they did and still do is quite different. But great women on stage will attract a more female audience. We still have more males though – that’s kind of the game – but I enjoy it very much. But it’s nice to cross roads while travelling with Tarja \[Turunen, formerly of Nightwish\] or Anneke \[van Giersbergen, formerly of The Gathering\] and we can talk about ANYTHING other than the music business!”

I then asked Liv what she thought the biggest achievement thus far for Leaves’ Eyes and emphatically she said it was their headlining set at Wacken Open Air 2012 with a full Viking ship and twenty Vikings running around. It probably didn’t hurt that Iron Maiden played right after them!  To that end, I had to ask what it’s like playing such huge shows and why bands still come to places like North America to only play for a few hundred a night:

“In the US the market is growing for this kind of music. I really appreciate that. It’s important to discover new markets. Europe is big when it comes to festivals, but club shows it’s not that attractive anymore. There is at least one show every day. And that’s a lot of money for the audience \[to pick and choose\]. In one city, like Vienna, you might have five shows on a Monday night – what do you do?  What can you expect?  People in Europe don’t really want to go out in the middle of the week. They’d rather go out on the weekends and save their money for the big festivals. I for one enjoy playing here. People are so grateful.”

## Fernando Ribeiro (Moonspell)

Meeting **Fernando Ribeiro**, vocalist of **Moonspell** was a real thrill. They’ve been one of my favorite bands since I discovered extreme metal and Fernando is one scary dude on stage. And in a leather jacket and pentagram-laden black t-shirt he still looked the part when he approached me with a mighty handshake inside the club. But talking to him, his passion for music is undeniable.

First I asked him how a tour with Leaves’ Eyes and Atrocity came together:

“\[Last year we did\] a tour with Marduk and Inquisition, kind of a more extreme bill, called Voices from the Dark. It went down really well. We kept getting feedback from the US fans to come up and have more time to play and do a co-headlining package tour. So our agent, Rock the Nation, thought about that and thought it’d be a good idea to change the musical perspective of the tour. Moonspell has a very symphonic, gothic feeling into it even though there’s a lot of extreme metal in what we do as well. So this was the perfect solution musically because Leaves’ Eyes is fronted by Liv and they have the symphonic, gothic arrangements going on. And Atrocity have played many styles throughout their career, but nowadays it’s more of a death metal set. So we all agreed it was a good and different package and we could reach a different crowd.”

\[caption id="attachment\_15373" align="alignright" width="300"\][![moonspell](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/moonspell-300x199.jpeg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/moonspell.jpeg) Moonspell\[/caption\]

Fernando calling his band “gothic metal” struck a chord. That term seems to have an ambiguous definition, but he has his own view on what it means. Ribeiro says the “gothic” elements come from a number of influences:

“I’m referring to bands that introduced gothic with a more metal background. Not only Moonspell but for instance Tiamat, Type O Negative (who have a little bit of gothic with the punk and hardcore) and also bands like Fields of Nephilim or The Nephilim, which actually for me did the perfect gothic metal record called _Zune_, which is heavy and fast like Slayer but also greatly atmospheric. It’s something dark, not necessarily sung by a woman, featuring female choirs or solo singers. I think the way Moonspell was conceived and born as a band – it’s harder to define Moonspell than to say define a thrash metal band or grindcore band because the way we reach this sound has to do with the age we were showing up and the context of the scene. In Europe there was a lot of room for avant-garde bands mixing darkness with metal. That was our generation in a way, so we listened to that but also in time to be a part of that movement in the '90s.”

We chatted about his vocal approach and lyrical inspiration a bit, but I was very much interested in learning a little bit more about the band’s heritage. I am hard-pressed to think of another metal band from Portugal, so I don’t know much about the country and its relationship with the genre. I asked Fernando what the scene is like out there, and what Portuguese influences are in Moonspell’s music:

“So far \[being from Portugal and playing metal\] it’s a very lonely position. Even though there is a metal scene in Portugal and it started in the late '70s, no other band could break through internationally as much as Moonspell has so far. It’s not a question of talent; it’s probably a question of opportunity. Even though we love our country and culturally and lyrically it’s an inspiration for us we knew the metal scene \[in Portugal\] wasn’t what we were looking for. \[A lot of bands\] were doing the Metallica, Slayer, and Sepultura thing then and we thought ‘Why would someone listen to a Portuguese band that sounds like Sepultura or Slayer?’  We always have this in mind and always have originality as something really in the forefront in our sound and as the message of our band. By putting some Portuguese elements in our music, that kind of was the charmer for the European scene and the German scene.”

Fernando admits that it’s difficult for Portuguese bands to break out, for a number of reasons. He says the same of Spain. He cites Inhuman and Heavenwood as two “contemporaries” of Moonspell that had their shot but didn’t take it. “There’s no pleasure in being alone,” he said. I reminded him that I wanted to hear more about the Portuguese influence on the sound, which he did expound on:

“We’re Portuguese. Everywhere we go, like if we go to a diner or something in the States, people might not think we’re from Portugal but they’ll know we’re from a weird country. Like we’re not supposed to be in Twin Falls eating pie or whatever. So they ask us and are very intrigued about our country because it is an intriguing country; there is some mysterious kind of unknown feeling about our country. That adds to our music greatly. Music-wise you should be listening to something called “fado” – it’s our traditional music. The Spanish have flamenco, the Argentineans have the tango and fado is our tango in a way. It’s melancholy, it’s longing, and a more fragile kind of thing, kind of like a visit there.”

We continued discussing the “Moonspell sound,” which is an ever-changing sound yet still recognizable. Fernando says there is a strange dichotomy to that idea; sure, they’re not a twin-guitar heavy metal band or a proper thrash band or something like that. But with each new album they want to push the boundary on what the “Moonspell sound” really is. I told him that I thought the most recent albums, _Night Eternal_, 2008, and _Alpha Noir_, 2012, have a bit more viciousness (a bit more “bite,” haha, wolf pun) and attention to brutality. He agreed:

“_Night Eternal_ is a very apocalyptic and crushing album. Even though it has songs like “Scorpion Flower,” it’s an album that flirts a lot with death metal. I mean we love it as well and we like to play it. If you pick up the _Night Eternal_ title track it’s a good example, I think, of what is gothic metal. It’s heavy as shit but still has the soprano and the moving feeling. I see a lot of people going wild in the pit but I also see a lot of gothic girls dancing to it as well. That’s kind of a perfect song for us. When it comes to _Alpha Noir_, we packaged the album _Omega White_ in the special edition \[and it’s _Omega White_ that has more of the gothic songs.\]  But _Alpha Noir_ is a very angry album. It’s an album that demands a new world. You can not do that in a subtle way. I think it’s time for a new world and _Alpha Noir_ is our manifest so it’s a loud one. We have a lot of fun playing _Alpha Noir_ songs because they are very intense and have a punk feeling and a dirtiness. And sometimes we hit it fast.”

The rest of our chat concluded with talking about having an intense stage presence and making sure they keep the dark intensity up on every show, which is something that I have witnessed first hand a number of times. We ended the conversation with Fernando saying that it’s time to calm down the touring and write a new album. He anticipates another headlining tour in 2015.
