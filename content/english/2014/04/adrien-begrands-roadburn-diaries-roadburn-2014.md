## Day One: Thursday, April 10

After a crazy, hurry-up-and-wait 24-hour travel day which included stops in Toronto, Paris, and Rotterdam, I arrived in Tilburg, Netherlands 15 minutes later than scheduled, but after a quick taxi ride, check-in at my hotel, and a swift 15-minute walk to the 013 Poppodium, I had my press credentials and hustled through the crowded, narrow Veemarktstraat and up the stairs of the Het Patronaat church annex to witness **Locrian**'s festival-opening set. What greeted me was the most ungodly wall of white noise, one of the loudest bands I've ever heard in this venue. On record Locrian can be very abstract, but this performance focused on the more visceral side of the band's sound, and it was extraordinary to witness in person.

A bit of a half hour lull kicked in afterward as the fest’s first day slowly built up steam. **Sourvein** in the theatre, **Brutus** in the Green Room, **Hull** in the Stage 01—three bands that do absolutely nothing for me. I popped into all shows, thought, ’Yep, still not my thing,’ and headed back to the Patronaat to catch **40 Watt Sun**. The venue quickly filled up, and the trio proceeded to play its typically pretty, weepy brand of doom. I had very fond memories of the band's performance in 2012, so I had no problem leaving 20 minutes into the set in order to check out **Regarde Les Hommes Tomber**, who annihilated a jam-packed Green Room with its doomy take on black metal.

One of the most anticipated events of the day was the set by **Beastmilk**. Mat McNerny is already a Roadburn veteran, having led Hexvessel onstage on more than one occasion here. This time around, instead of playing innovative folk metal, he's playing derivative post-punk, and for all its slavish mimicking of Joy Division a dozen years after it was fashionable, it has clicked, both with metal fans who don't know how unoriginal it is and with those who have a weakness for vintage goth. Interestingly the songs that worked best were the more forceful selections, such as "Death Reflects Us" and "Genocidal Crush.” It was also a nice, upbeat respite from all that day’s doom ’n’ gloom.

After a quick glimpse of **Samothrace**, who were mind-blowingly good and convinced me to listen to their previous album more often, I officially hit the wall. When you're almost fainting standing watching a band, it's time for a break. So I enjoyed one of my favourite indulgences in Tilburg, a Trappist burger at Polly Maggoo over on the local restaurant row around the corner, with frites, mayo (of course), washed down with the wonderful locally brewed La Trappe dubbel, while wondering if I should have been a little smarter and spent the extra money to get here a day early and be properly rested up. When you immerse yourself in music like I do at Roadburn, the pace can be relentless and punishing, and the fact that I was already feeling it was a dire sign.

I could only spare a half hour to relax, as I had to see **Cult of Dom Keller**, one of my must-see bands of the day. I first learned of them three years ago when they put out a split single with Shooting Guns, and they were even better than expected, very much in keeping with the heavy Can vibe, playing lengthy, hypnotic heavy rock jams that were catchy, groovy, and quite ferocious. Unfortunately the band was so good I had to miss Nothing's hyped performance at the Patronaat, but I didn't need to see an overrated Ride cover band. I zipped into the main stage to see **Corrections House**, who came off as very convincing with their blend of riffs, industrial beats, and snarled poetry by Mike IX Williams. I'd rather have seen him with Eyehategod, but it was still solid.

Liverpool doom kings **Conan** were the big draw of the day, and the Patronaat quickly filled to capacity. I had a prime spot as they started, sounding the heaviest I have ever heard—this side of YOB anyway—but two ten-minute songs in, I was a wreck, the exhaustion setting in again despite my recently downed Red Bull. At the Patronaat, there's one thing you do when you're tired: head upstairs to the plush balcony. I luckily found a quiet corner, and after dozing off twice while writing my notes—it took me five minutes to write one sentence—I drifted off, awash in the thunderous, reverberating sounds of Conan’s spectacular set.

\[caption id="attachment\_15547" align="alignleft" width="300"\][![Anciients](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/anciients-1-300x200.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/anciients-1.jpg) Anciients\[/caption\]

Strangely, after that surreal power nap, in more ways than one, I felt the best I had in 12 hours, and after a quick peek at **Crowbar**—_yep, that sounds like Crowbar_—I headed to the Green Room to see **Anciients**’ first European show. Oddly, it was the first time I’ve seen them live in a year and a half. They sounded fantastic, benefiting hugely from the impeccable mix, and the packed room was very enthusiastic as the band played "Overthrone,” "Falling in Line,” and a new song during their 45 minute set.

After a peek at **Bong**’s main-stage show—like Crowbar, Bong was Bong—I scored a good spot in the tiny Stage 01 where Finnish duo **Mantar** played a sensational blend of sludge, doom, and pure rock ’n’ roll. Half an hour in, though, it was time to call it a day. Over to the quirky and noisy take-out joint Karnak for a traditional midnight dürum döner kebab, then the weary 15-minute shuffle back to the hotel, where I immediately slept for ten hours.

## Day Two: Friday, April 11

If there ever was a perfect harbinger for this day, it was the sound of a gong being struck playfully by a stagehand outside the 013 as I was walking up to the venue in the early afternoon. Under the curation of **Opeth's Mikael Åkerfeldt**, the progressive rock lineup of a lifetime had been assembled, with such staggering talents on the main stage that I would be camping out there from three in the afternoon to one in the morning. A day of prog for the ages.

**Promise & the Monster** kicked things off in understated fashion in the Green Room, Billie Lindahl's haunting, pastoral sounds reminding me of Hanne Hukkelberg and many other unique female singer-songwriters from Scandinavia I love so much. Not your standard Roadburn fare, but a brave choice by Åkerfeldt, and her music did not go unappreciated.

\[caption id="attachment\_15556" align="alignright" width="300"\][![Magma](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/magma-1-300x200.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/magma-1.jpg) Magma\[/caption\]

At 3:30 it was time for the first of five enormous heavy hitters on the main stage. And how do you describe the indescribable? France's legendary **Magma** played the most powerful, peculiar, beautiful progressive rock imaginable, the octet singing in tongues, vibraphone and piano punctuating the music alongside the incredible drumming of founder and bandleader Christian Vander. It was creepy, playful, mournful, joyous. And above all else, alien. Not of this world, but miraculously so. I sat there on a terrace halfway up, leaning on the wall, agog, mesmerized. The effect was so visceral I had to catch my breath when the show ended.

Comprised of acoustic guitar, electric bass, violin, flute, bongos, and male and female singing, there's something ancient and pagan about **Comus**. It starts off pretty, prancing down the English garden path, but then starts turning over the stones, exposing a side that's earthy and unsettling. All of Comus's debut album was performed, but the most crucial inclusion on this day in particular was the standard "Drip Drip,” which contains the lyrics that inspired Åkerfeldt to name Opeth's third album _My Arms, Your Hearse_. It was a spellbinding performance by a band that sounded a thousand years old without coming across as gimmicky and fake. Coming from these understated men on chairs (and the charming Bobbie Watson of course) this felt so much more sincere and real than folk metal, which reduces it all to a cartoon.

\[caption id="attachment\_15553" align="alignleft" width="300"\][![Goblin](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/goblin-1-300x200.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/goblin-1.jpg) Goblin\[/caption\]

A half hour later the main stage was jam packed for the hugely anticipated set by Italian prog innovators **Goblin**. It started off in fascinating style, first with the taut, jazzy “Snip Snap” followed by searing hard rock of “Roller.” Of course, most people were dying to hear Goblin’s more horror-oriented fare, and gregarious leader Claudio Simonetti led the band through selections from _Dawn of the Dead_ and _Phenomena_ as clips from the films played on the huge screen behind. A band that truly deserves the adjective “cinematic”, Simonetti's keyboard playing carried the pieces into murky, atmospheric directions. At the same time, though, Goblin could bring the groove, which they proved on “Tenebre,” a track that had the usual laid-back Roadburn crowd moving, and dare I say, dancing. And when the foursome launched into the opening bars of the timeless melody of “Suspiria,” it was clear the thrill of seeing it performed live wasn't lost on most people.

After a welcome break in the action to recharge, it was back to the main stage to see **Candlemass** perform the much-loved 1988 album _Ancient Dreams_. It was all faithfully done, the band in fine form, the versatile Mats Leven once again proving to be an outstanding lead singer, but something about this set felt a little anticlimactic for me. Perhaps it was because it’d be hard to top that incredible show the band played at Noctis 666 last September, or maybe it was because it just couldn’t sustain the momentum set by Goblin’s sensational set. And it didn’t help that **Obliteration** were, well, obliterating the Green Room around the corner. Every time a Candlemass song ended, you’d hear an ungodly rumble in the background, with people starting to drift into the Green Room to see what the ruckus was about. Indeed, the Norwegian band’s devout take on old-timey Swedish death metal was ragged, energetic, and contagious, the room continuing to fill by the minute.

\[caption id="attachment\_15557" align="alignright" width="200"\][![Opeth](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/opeth-1-200x300.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/opeth-1.jpg) Opeth\[/caption\]

While it would have been cool to see Terra Tenebrosa do its avant-garde thing in the Patronaat—and indeed the cool crowd was there in full force—nothing would tear me away from the 013 on this incredible night, especially with **Opeth** bringing it all to a much-anticipated climax. In previewing Mikael Åkerfeldt’s curated day here, I speculated that Opeth’s headlining set would reflect all elements of the music he had brought in, and indeed that’s exactly what he and the band did in a 90-minute performance that covered all the bases of Opeth’s oeuvre. Although no tracks from the band’s new album (which includes a song called “Goblin,” interestingly enough) were aired, there was prog (“The Devil’s Orchard”), psychedelic (“Atonement”), and much to the satisfaction of most people there, plenty of old material, including “White Cluster,” “Deliverance,” and “Blackwater Park.” In this tremendous environment, with all factors coalescing beautifully (venue, performance, mix, audience) it was the best Opeth show I have ever seen, a perfect way to end a revelatory day.

## Day Three: Saturday, April 12

After spending Thursday fighting exhaustion and experiencing prog heaven on Friday, Day Three of Roadburn was something I was really looking forward to: the day things got seriously nuts. As fun as seeing established acts is, discovering your new favourite band here is a huge part of the experience, and this day’s lineup was jam-packed with artists from both sides of the fence.

UK band **11 Paranoias** started off in sensational fashion with its soaring hybrid of doom and space rock, sounding as dreamy yet crushing in a revelatory performance. A friend urged me to not miss this set, and I’m glad I didn’t, because it stopped me dead in my tracks. Over on the main stage, **Noothgrush** grushed their neeth as well as you'd expect. It was all well and good, but American sludge has been boring me as of late, and I was looking for musical discoveries on this day, which I found when I meandered into the Stage 01 room. Led by Kimi Kärki of Reverend Bizarre, the _kosmische_ project **E-Musikgruppe Lux Ohr** started off tentatively, but ever-so-slowly built momentum, with magnificent improvisation atop a hypnotic synth arrangement.

If there ever was a time when I was thankful I arrived early for a set, it was for **Circle**. After hilariously stripping down and dressing in spandex onstage, the Finnish innovators steamrolled through an hour-long set that veered wildly from krautrock grooves, Beefheart jams, to raucous rock ’n’ roll that echoed Blue Öyster Cult, Stooges, and Turbonegro. Possessing the chops to do that is one thing, but to pull it off so seamlessly is genius, and Circle was a joy to witness.

\[caption id="attachment\_15559" align="alignright" width="300"\][![YOB](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/yob-1-300x200.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/yob-1.jpg) YOB\[/caption\]

Doom upstarts **Windhand** captivated a full main stage audience, but quite frankly didn’t blow me away at all. **Papir** played some more laid-back jams in a sweltering Stage 01, but yours truly was still reeling from Circle's psychotic set, and it wasn't until **YOB** kicked into its performance of the album _The Great Cessation_ that my energy returned. But that'll happen when you park yourself underneath the towering monolith of PA beside the stage. YOB is extraordinary, its sound thick enough to seem tactile.

As intense as **Indian** is on record, it pales in comparison to the live experience, and it felt like the guys were about to level the Patronaat with their distinct, malevolent doom. It was shattering, and when I left early the lineup to get in was the longest for a Patronaat show I'd ever seen.

Next up was Finland’s **Mansion**, who blew me away a year ago with its debut EP, and whose devout doomsday cult songs and image was utterly convincing heavy rock theatre. The six-piece band was captivating playing old material and new, and when the set climaxed with singer Alma's stern demeanour giving way to a complete breakdown, the audience was enraptured.

\[caption id="attachment\_15555" align="alignleft" width="200"\][![Loop](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/loop-1-200x300.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/loop-1.jpg) Loop\[/caption\]

After that set, I dashed around the corner to the main theatre and caught the last hour of **Loop**’s festival-headlining show. Innovative for its use of psychedelia and krautrock repetition within the shoegaze milieu, it was hypnotic, flawless, and very, very loud; waves of guitars wafting, vibrating, flooding the big room. “Collision,” “Arc-Lite,” and “Fever Knife” were big highlights, and a gracious Robert Hampson dedicated “Burning World” to popular Roadburn organizer Walter Hoeijmakers. The foursome returned for an encore of “Breathe Into Me” and a cover of Can’s seminal “Mother Sky” that transformed the classic into a roaring, glorious jam.

As soon as Loop ended, the crowd in the Green Room, which was already full, overflowed well into the hall as **Inter Arma** played its experimental black metal. Drummer TJ Childers beat and flailed away with force, flamboyance, and precision, even using a big tree branch on a couple of surreal occasions. His personality gave this innovative, eclectic performance a level of charisma you don't see enough in US black metal.

After popping in to see **Harsh Toke** jam away, it was a moment where you knew nothing would equal the previous four bands. In the end, the big bands (Circle, Loop, YOB) didn't disappoint, and I now have a new favourite band in 11 Paranoias. Saturday’s mission accomplished.

## Day Four: The Afterburner

Fatigue is always inevitable at music festivals, but the exhaustion at Roadburn is particularly unique, in that the immersion in music and art is so complete, so intense for nearly 12 hours a day, that if you're not careful the thousand yard stare will set in. For me, if I don't take an hour in the busy night to sit down, eat, and recharge, I'm going to pay dearly later on. Still, try as I might, it's always a huge challenge getting through the annual Sunday Afterburner, even though it's paced a lot slower than the previous three days.

One thing I always do on Sunday is check out the art exhibit at the nearby Gust van Dijk gallery, and this year’s was of particular interest for me. A regular contributor to Roadburn’s poster art in the past, Romanian artist **Costin Chioreanu** has emerged as a startling and original talent, his work transcending metal clichés and incorporating elements of Escher and Cezanne. Unlike John Dyer Baizley, whose work is very iconic, there's more of a narrative quality to Chioreanu art, often a fascinating balance of darkness and innocence. The gallery had a very impressive collection of his black ink work, including a couple illustrations that were used for posters this year. A neat little quirk was the display of cassette covers he designed as a kid, adorning his bootlegged albums by Darkthrone, Death, and Voivod with his own unique interpretations of the original album art. Even as a youngster you could see he had a real knack for the craft.

Over at the 013, the day started in sombre fashion with a special tribute to the late Selim Lemouchi, who died mere weeks before he and his band was slated to perform at Roadburn. Featuring eleven musicians onstage, including his sister (and collaborator in The Devil’s Blood) Farida, S**elim Lemouchi’s Enemies** performed the 2013 album _Earth Air Spirit Water Fire_ in its entirety.

Personally, I hated the album when it came out, and I found it not the least bit troubling that the incredibly talented Lemouchi was moving from his marvelous heavy rock to such meandering progressive rock. With the very sloppy final Devil’s Blood album earlier that year and this equally sprawling record, it felt as though Lemouchi was coming unglued, and I said as much in my review. When you mercilessly trash a record like I did with that one, and the musician dies a few months later, you can't help but feel you owe it to the musician to try to give the music another chance. To be honest, I felt bad, and actually bought the album instead of asking the label for another promo download. I owed it to the guy, someone I’d admired as a musician since 2007, to try to appreciate the music once more.

As I watched the band play onstage, my frustration with the album came back once more. I just couldn’t buy into the compositions completely. It was a transitional album, as Lemouchi was still trying to find himself as an artist. Yet something extraordinary happened late in the set as the band played “The Deep Dark Waters.” The song made its shift into mellow, atmospheric prog, some absolutely gorgeous solos were performed, and stunning slow motion film clips of Lemouchi being drenched in water appeared on the gigantic screen behind. While that happened the band hit a level of Pink Floyd grandeur that the album only hinted at. And that's when it hit me, and it probably hit everyone else, how we all could sense the greatness that Lemouchi could have achieved if he'd stuck around a bit longer. His mercurial body of work feels so tragically incomplete, but he was a major talent, and this loving tribute was a beautiful way to send him off.

\[caption id="attachment\_15552" align="alignright" width="200"\][![Bölzer](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bölzer-1-200x300.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bölzer-1.jpg) Bölzer\[/caption\]

The mood needed a serious lift after that moving set, and rising death metal stars **Bölzer** were just the thing. Word of mouth surrounding the Swiss duo has been building steadily over the past year, and it was clear the band is catching on, as the biggest overflow crowd I’ve ever seen at Roadburn gathered around the entrance of the Green Room to catch a glimpse, to be enveloped by their swirling, atmospheric music. Thankfully there was PA in the lobby so those outside the room could hear the guys play their intense, oddly haunting music. Hoping for an easier way in, I went back upstairs and tried the back door of the Green Room balcony, and finally was able to wriggle in and experience the music a little more intimately. I’d already seen Bölzer before—like Candlemass, at Noctis—and this show proved to be just as impressive, although the band clearly was none too happy with their performance.

Meanwhile, back at the main stage was a set I was personally looking forward to, Candlemass leader Leif Edling’s new project **Avatarium**. Although Edling had to sit this show out—Anders Iwers from Tiamat filled in—it was still a very enjoyable show by a band that’s still finding its footing. Singer Jennie-Ann Smith gives Edling a very unique style to work with, and the band’s combination of doom, psychedelic, and folk worked well in a live setting, with Smith excelling on songs like “Moonhorse” and “Lady in the Lamp.”

Despite this lighter pace, the exhaustion set in very quickly, and if I was going to endure all of Triptykon’s hugely anticipated show, I’d have to recharge, so I hoofed it back to my hotel for a cheap feast of sandwiches, fruit, Dutch cheese, and beer purchased at a local supermarket earlier in the morning. That meant I wound up missing the first 45 minutes of YOB’s second performance at the fest, but since I saw them the other day, it was no big loss. So I made my way back onto the venue, which was thundering away thanks to the trio’s typically gigantic sound, and took my now-traditional spot underneath the PA (this time with earplugs!) and took in the power from up close.

\[caption id="attachment\_15558" align="alignleft" width="200"\][![Triptykon](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/triptykon-1-200x300.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/triptykon-1.jpg) Triptykon\[/caption\]

This day was all about the build-up towards **Triptykon**, and judging by how briskly the new album _Melana Chasmata_ was selling upstairs—made available a day early for Roadburn attendees—I wasn’t the only one who thought so. The theatre started filling up early, and I was able to secure the best vantage point in the building, the first terrace above the floor, which gives you an unfettered view, not to mention maximum sonic impact. And at nine PM sharp the lights dimmed and the strains of “Crucifixus” kicked in as the band made its way onstage. Immediately Thomas Fischer and company proceeded to pull the rug out from everybody, starting with 12-minute closing epic on the new album, “Black Snow,” then launching into the _Eparistera Daimones_ track “Goetia.”

“This is our first concert for the new album,” announced Fischer, wryly adding,” and that’s why we’re going to play an old song.” The opening bars of “Circle of the Tyrants” were played, and the crowd went nuts, a modest mosh pit even starting during the classic song’s thrash section, a rarity for this festival. Fischer was in a strangely good mood too, cracking a smile when fans shouted “OOH!” in imitation of their hero. New songs “Altar of Deceit” and “Tree of Suffocating Souls” were debuted, Celtic Frost’s “Visions of Mortality” was carted out, Hellhammer’s “Messiah” was dedicated to the much-loved Walter Hoeijmakers, and the show concluded with a gargantuan rendition of “The Prolonging.” Aided by guitarist V. Santura, drummer Norman Lonhard, and the perpetually badass Vanja Slajh on bass, Fischer and Triptykon were spellbinding.

Although Fischer was scheduled to hold a post-show signing session, and although Heretic was playing down the street, with Morne to follow at the main stage, that was it for me. My Roadburn was done. There’d be no topping Triptykon, I’d already seen a lifetime’s worth of bands over the course of four long days, and my body and mind were both saying, “No more.”

Roadburn 2014 was an extraordinary festival in more ways than one. As always, it’s an absolute feast of underground music, experienced in a world-class venue amidst respectful concertgoers, held in a charming little city that clearly has a deep appreciation of the arts. But this year felt like a turning point, where bands like Magma, Promise and the Monster, Goblin, and Loop showed that Roadburn’s scope can easily widen well past the doom/sludge metal demographic and still go over extremely well. New doors were opened this year, and it now feels like the sky’s the limit.

Now to just figure out a way to get back there.
