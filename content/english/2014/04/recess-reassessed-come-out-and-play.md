[![Twisted Sister 05-76_pub](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Twisted-Sister-05-76_pub.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Twisted-Sister-05-76_pub.jpg)After ceaseless rock ‘n’ roll hurdles overcome, and a legacy of thousands of sweaty shows, Twisted Sister’s third LP, 1984’s _Stay Hungry_, had brought the rewards the band so clearly sought. _Stay Hungry_ sold over three millions copies in the US, millions more overseas, and all that success was a well-deserved triumph for Twisted Sister, the band having never given up on doggedly pursuing their moment in the spotlight.

However, as much as _Stay Hungry_ brought long-overdue chart and arena-headlining acclaim for Twisted Sister, it also sounded the death knell for the band, with a sharp fall from grace soon to follow.

##  Ascending to heavy metal stardom

Twisted Sister had played to packed out clubs and gone on to sell out venues in the US in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, but the band had never been able to capitalise on that success with a record deal at home. In 1982, following a groundswell of interest in the UK press, Twisted Sister headed to Blighty to get its recording career off the ground, signing to Secret Records — then home to punk bands such as The Exploited. Secret released Twisted Sister’s _Ruff Cuts_ EP, quickly followed by the band’s debut LP, _Under The Blade_, which was produced by **UFO** bassist **Pete Way**, and holds the distinction of being the first metal LP I ever purchased.

_Under The Blade_ was a raw and brutish release, filled with captivating blue-collar metal that came with an almost punk rock kick. However, the version of the album most fans have heard was the more polished remix, re-released by Atlantic Records to capitalise on Twisted Sister’s post-_Stay Hungry_ success.

At the time of _Under The Blade_’s initial release, the album was met with appreciative howls, particularly from UK and European audiences, and rightly so. _Under The Blade_ is, unquestionably, a classic debut. It’s crammed with catchy songs honed to a razors edge through years of being played in clubs. _Under The Blade_ mixed Twisted Sister’s street-wise stomp, grease-paint garishness, gritty NWOBHM-worship and brash swagger to perfection, and tours of the US and UK festival performances sealed Twisted Sister's reputation as a Herculean live act.

The band’s costumes and made-up mugs underscored Twisted Sister’s blurring of the line between macho metal and shock and glam rock’s tastelessness, and in 1983 _You Can't Stop Rock 'N' Roll_ arrived — with Twisted Sister benefiting from the goodwill raised from their first independent album by signing a deal with Atlantic Records. _You Can't Stop Rock 'N' Roll_ was a storming LP. It was rowdy, confident, and a little less ragged round the edges than Twisted Sister’s first album (no surprise, given _You Can't Stop Rock 'N' Roll_’s major label backing), and it too was stacked with ravenous, belligerent, and anthemic songs.

Which brings us back to 1984 and _Stay Hungry_, the album that brought Twisted Sister their long-awaited fame and fortune, and put the band’s grotesque glam and roughneck metal right onto the arena stage. As ridiculous as it might sound today, _Stay Hungry_ was inspired by the never-give-up attitude of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 1977 book, _Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder_, and the album found Tom Werman sitting behind the production desk. Twisted Sister and Werman clashed over his studio methods, with Snider being chiefly concerned that Werman’s production would mute the band’s aggression. That sparked inter-band tensions too and, in the end, Werman did shave the burrs off Twisted Sister.

_Stay Hungry_ mixed slicker, more commercially friendly singles like "We're Not Gonna Take It" and "I Wanna Rock" with heavier tracks such as “Burn in Hell,” the multipart "Horror-Teria” suite, and “S.M.F.” The album endeavoured to balance songs that appealed to Twisted Sister’s established audience and to grab ahold of metal’s new generation of fans — those enjoying the genre’s burst of '80s success, thanks to Quiet Riot’s _Metal Health_ being the first metal album to hit number one on the Billboard charts a year earlier.

Twisted Sister’s videos soon became a staple on MTV, amplifying the band’s (then) outrageous image and rebellious rock, and the band became a radio fixture. Howls of protest from the Parents' Music Resource Center (PMRC) soon followed, seeing Snider make his famous appearance at US Senate hearings to discuss metal’s supposedly wayward influence, and controversy aside, it looked like Twisted Sister had finally made it.

Unfortunately, as we all know, mainstream success also presents somewhat of a double-edged sword. Twisted Sister’s radio-friendly direction, MTV overexposure, and the band’s clear enjoyment of strutting about in the limelight left some long-term fans feeling estranged from the relentless underdog band that Twisted Sister once were. According to Snider’s highly entertaining autobiography, _Shut up and Give Me the Mic_, that PMRC attention, and a wariness of the band’s chart success from diehard fans, eventually drew a cloud over the band’s next album, 1985’s _Come Out and Play_.

## Falling from grace

Even though Twisted Sister were always a formidable live band, and more “Cinderella’s ugly stepsisters” than handsome hit-makers, the band’s reliance on chart baiting tactics with a track like _Stay Hungry_’s "We're Not Gonna Take It" meant the one-hit-wonder chasm (two-hit, if you count the album’s "I Wanna Rock") loomed large.

Snider had actually sketched out "We're Not Gonna Take It" as far back as 1979, and the songs owes a debt to UK glam bands like Slade, which gives it more musical depth than might first appear. However, none of that mattered to previously staunch fans, who only saw their beloved band going pop, and a Top 20 audience is fickle too.

Twister Sister were already victims of their own success by the time of _Come Out and Play_’s release. However, the band was seemingly unaware of that, making plans for world domination with _Come Out and Play_’s tracks, artwork, videos, and Twisted Sister’s costumes and extravagant arena tour meticulously planned to unlock the door to even greater success.

Snider was convinced that _Come Out and Play_ would unify, what he saw, as a fragmenting heavy metal audience. However, ultimately, all the momentum the band had built up over the preceding years was quickly derailed. It really didn’t matter that Twisted Sister had released three excellent albums before _Come Out and Play_, the band simply faced a very difficult decision in finding some way to appease both old and new fans. In the end, _Come Out and Play_’s legacy wasn’t to be the great unifying record Snider envisioned but is widely regarded as the first step in the band’s impending demise.

There’s no denying that _Come Out and Play_ was poorly received both critically and commercially, especially in comparison to _Stay Hungry_. The album eventually went gold in the US, which is obviously nothing to complain about these days, but _Stay Hungry_ had sold six times that number in the US alone, so both the band and their label had good reason to be concerned.

However, as much as _Come Out and Play_ is presumed to be a disaster, it’s entirely unfair to dismiss it as anywhere near a complete catastrophe. Sure, _Come Out and Play_ doesn’t measure up to _Under the Blade_ or _You Can’t Stop Rock ‘n’ Roll_, but by 1985 Twisted Sister were in an entirely different and somewhat unenviable position, busily trying to find some balance between being a household name and retaining a sense of their earlier metal murderousness.

The band had helped usher in glam metal, but Twisted Sister wanted to be a tawdry metal act, not a glittering example of rock ’n’ roll androgyny. Unfortunately, _Come Out and Play_ ended up being a somewhat confused mix of both, melding metal-and-pop-friendly tracks together, which proved a step too far for many of the band’s previous fans.

## Recess, reassessed

_Come Out and Play_ certainly starts well, with clanging bottles paying homage to the cult classic film _Warriors_ on the title track. “Come Out and Play” made for an appropriately gutter-metal onslaught too, highlighting Twisted Sister’s New York roots. Follow-up track "Leader of the Pack ” had an old-school history too. Twisted Sister had originally covered the Shangri-Las' classic on the band’s _Ruff Cuts_ EP. But "Leader of the Pack”’s presence on _Come Out and Play_ (a clear attempt to mesh former glories with the band’s current status) was also seen as a gimmick, blatantly set on establishing continued chart success.

The reception for _Come Out and Play_ wasn’t helped by having noted Scorpions producer Dieter Dierks essentially erase the last (and crucial) vestiges of abrasiveness Twisted Sister retained from their club days. MTV fare, like "Be Chrool To Your Scuel,” was fun enough — and featured the additional talents of Alice Cooper, Clarence Clemons, Brian Setzer, Billy Joel and many other guests. However, the song’s jaunty tone took such a blatant stab at attracting a pop audience (although MTV subsequently banned the video for "Be Chrool To Your Scuel") that formerly steadfast fans were left scratching, not banging, their heads.

Elsewhere, the turgid ballad “I Believe in You” didn’t come close to evoking the poignancy of a track like Stay Hungry’s “The Price” either. But, that said, _Come Out to Play_ wasn’t a calamity by any means. The album also featured plenty of neck-cracking, albeit shinier metallic tracks, like “The Fire Still Burns,” “Kill or be Killed” and “Lookin’ Out for #1.” And, while “I Believe in Rock 'n' Roll” and “You Want What We Got” might not have featured the out-and-out contagious choruses of tracks like “Bad Boys (Of Rock 'N Roll)” or “The Kids are Back,” they still made an admirable charge at catchy and captivating territory.

Glossy production aside, if _Come Out and Play_ has one clear fault, it’s in Snider’s hurried sense of songwriting — but even that’s understandable.

### Buckling under the pressure

Twisted Sister was rearing to maximize every available avenue to continue their success, and while the band’s grand plans for _Come Out and Play_ never came close to fruition, you certainly can’t fault Twisted Sister’s ambition. Although the band might well point to a raft of different issues effecting _Come Out and Play_’s poor reception, including that aforementioned PMRC attention and tensions in the band, the truth is, the songs just weren’t good enough.

For all of Snider’s claims that _Come Out and Play_ featured some of his best songwriting, he’d also been writing all of Twisted Sister’s material for years, and every songwriter hits the wall on occasion. Snider had always been more of melody maker than technical maestro, and with the rest of Twisted Sister not contributing any major creative ideas, _Come Out and Play_ simply sounded like he buckled under the pressure of trying to follow-up a smash hit.

Of course, that’s somewhat forgivable too. Because the lacklustre material lying within _Come Out and Play_ is the inevitable result of Snider having already stacked three previous albums with plenty of ripping tracks — and we’ve nothing to complain about there.

_Come Out and Play_ is nowhere near a classic Twisted Sister album, even if the band had set out to produce their defining work. However, _Come Out and Play_ isn’t the catastrophe it’s often accused of being either. Twisted Sister were always fans of NWOBHM heroes such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, and you can still hear that in Eddie "Fingers" Ojeda and Jay Jay French’s intertwining leads and riffing on a track like "The Fire Still Burns" — no matter how much the production polishes the snags and snarls.

Ultimately, Twisted Sister’s image and profile saw the band unfairly lumped in with the poppy hair metal crowd, and the band never had enough time to get comfortable in the upper reaches of the charts or mark out its own distinct, chest-beating domain. The confusion about who the band were — metal, hard rock, or fluffy, flamboyant metal — was born out on the subsequent tour for _Come Out and Play_, with Twisted Sister’s core fanbase (those devoted S.M.F.’s of the past) deserting in droves.

Half-filled houses greeted Twisted Sister in the US, and the band were losing money hand over fist with _Come Out and Play_’s elaborate stage show, leading to a string of rearranged and cancelled shows before Snider eventually faked a throat ailment to halt the tour completely. The band played to larger audiences in Europe, where _Come Out and Play_ was more warmly received, but more inter-band turmoil saw drummer A. J. Pero exit Twisted Sister in 1986.

By the time Twisted Sister returned in August 1987, with the abysmal _Love is for Suckers_, the band was deeply in debt, and basically dead in the water. Although released as a Twisted Sister album, the Beau Hill (grossly over-) produced _Love is for Suckers_ was, for all intents and purposes, a Snider solo release. However, Atlantic Records were only willing to release the album under the Twisted Sister banner, and aside from strong opener “Wake up (The Sleeping Giant),” the rest of the album desperately clutched for chart success.

A brief tour followed, but the band was doomed, and with _Love is for Suckers_ selling a handful of copies, Snider announced his departure from Twisted Sister two months after the album’s release. Atlantic records promptly dropped Twisted Sister, and the band went into hibernation.

Now, _Come Out and Play_ might well be seen as the penultimate chapter in the Twisted Sister tale, the album where the band took their first step towards the rock 'n' roll abyss. Certainly, _Come Out and Play_ does go down in the record books as the very first CD to ever go out of print, but _Come Out and Play_ was also Twisted Sister’s second biggest selling album worldwide, and the band did manage to play some well-regarded shows around the time of its release.

Like many an album struck down by mainstream indifference and inter-band squabbling, it’s not that _Come Out and Play_ is a disaster or even a fiasco, it’s simply that the surrounding circumstances have coloured it as such. Sure, _Under the Blade_, _You Can't Stop Rock 'n' Roll_, and _Stay Hungry_ are far better albums, but _Come Out and Play_ still adds an appendix to that trilogy that’s well worth visiting. _Come Out and Play_ is great example of what happens when a band struggles for years, suddenly rises to dizzying heights, and then gets incinerated by endeavouring to remain under the mainstream spotlight.

Admittedly, _Come Out and Play_ is maligned by many. But, while it undeniably represents a band headed for destruction, that shouldn’t be confused with it being a complete artistic failure.

Obviously, these days, Twisted Sister is back, touring on and off since reforming in late 2001. This year, the band celebrates the 30th anniversary of _Stay Hungry_ with another round of dates in Europe and the US, and while it would be a lie to say the band are all best of buddies, they’re certainly aware and appreciative of the importance of Twisted Sister’s legacy for many fans — and, you know, the bankable value of that.

A steady stream of releases from Twisted Sister over the years has seen the usual compilations appear, and _Club Daze Volume 1: The Studio Sessions_ and _Volume 2: Live in the Bars_ are worth investigating for a glimpse into Twisted Sister's pre-_Under the Blade_ ventures. In 2004, the band released _Still Hungry_, a complete re-recording of _Stay Hungry_ that brings the rawness and heaviness the band first imagined their biggest hit to have to the fore.

The band’s visceral _Live At Hammersmith_ is also well worth seeking out too. It’s easily the band’s best live recording, capturing Twisted Sister on the London stage, right on the cusp of _Stay Hungry_’s success. Twisted Sister’s catalogue has, of course, also been remastered and reissued as well, and tracking down a fresh copy of _Under the Blade_, with its original mix and the bonus DVD of Twisted Sister’s legendary performance at 1982’s Reading Festival, is heartily advised.

Finally, if you want a glimpse into Twisted Sister’s history, then Snider’s aforementioned autobiography is a must read. _Shut up and Give Me the Mic_ is hilariously snarky, taking shots at everyone, but for even more caustic tales from the Twisted Sister trenches, issue #3 of _Chips and Beer_ magazine has a superb overview of the band’s career, and a raft of features on New York’s '70s and '80s metal hooligans. (Actually, while you’re there, you might as well pick up every single copy of [_Chips and Beer_](http://chipsandbeermag.tumblr.com/), because it’s the most entertaining metal magazine by a mile.)
