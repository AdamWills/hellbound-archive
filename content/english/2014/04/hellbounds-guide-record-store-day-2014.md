This Saturday, April 19th is **Record Store Day 2014**, a day when music collectors line up early in the morning in the hopes of getting their hands on some new and often exclusive records.

## What is Record Store Day?

Record Store Day was conceived in 2007 at a gathering of independent record store owners and employees as a way to celebrate and spread the word about the unique culture surrounding nearly 1000 independently owned record stores in the US and thousands of similar stores internationally. There are Record Store Day participating stores on every continent except Antarctica. (from [recordstoreday.com](http://www.recordstoreday.com/))

For record collectors, the major incentive to care about this occasion (beyond, possibly, a deep and general appreciation for independent record stores) is the [special release list](http://www.recordstoreday.com/SpecialReleases), and the potential to snag a rare collectors' item-to be. The list isn't genre-specific – you'll see titles to appeal to a wide range of tastes – but you're guaranteed to find some mouth-watering metal releases scheduled for special Record Store Day release. The trick, though, can be actually snagging one of these babies...
