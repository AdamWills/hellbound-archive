Taking their name from a Clive Barker story, **The Body Politic** share a similar desire to take their art in new directions. Opening track "Vtam Agere" is the perfect intro to the EP, short ,modern and original, and something that would work well in film soundtrack. Second track "Armature" shows the band to be technically adroit but not at the expense of song-writing. "All Hands" mixes precision with power, while "Swing For The Fences" shows The Body Politic are very much making music for the 21st century. "Colqhoun" has a raw power to match its melodies. Finishing with the fine "Irradiate," it’s clear that The Body Politic are a band with the potential to cross over to a wide audience indeed.
