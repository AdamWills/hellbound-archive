Passion and sincerity are what matters most in music, and **Disparager** have an overabundance of those.

Opening with "Pictures," the band show themselves as technically adroit but never at the expense of the actual song. "Tuesday Love" is raw in its emotion; this is an antidote to the fake music that clogs up the airwaves like fat in an old man’s arteries. "Gratitude" reminds me of Cave In with its juxtaposition of darkness and light. My favourite track on the EP is the heartfelt "R.I.P Bill Hicks" (Bill Hicks was a genius and the world is a poorer place for his passing— look up some of his work for proof). Finishing with the epic "At Least I Still Have Bob Iver," Disparager show themselves as a band with passion, a strong identity, and a reason to be. Not many bands can say that.
