Autumn doesn't officially arrive in the northern hemisphere until the fall equinox – due this year on the 23rd of September. But for many of us, the final long weekend of summer marks the change in seasons we actually _feel_. Here at Hellbound we're saying "see you later, summer" with another set of **staff playlists: the Labour Day weekend edition**. Here, in addition to some general selections, you'll find listed a few songs about work and some of our top metal picks of the year so far.

### Gruesome Greg

**LABOUR DAY TRACK** Eyehategod – "Kill Your Boss" (does not apply if you're self-employed) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq3k1U2FSJ4

**METAL PICK OF THE YEAR SO FAR** Brimstone Coven – self-titled (super sleeper pick for album of the year; if you see 'em live, you'll get it)

**LISTENING** YOB – _Clearing the Path to Ascend_ (Neurot Recordings) Earth – _Primitive and Deadly_ (Southern Lord) Accept – _Blind Rage_ (Nuclear Blast) The Monks – _Bad Habits_ (!!!) (EMI)

### Rob Hughes

**LABOUR DAY TRACK** Styx – “Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)” I love this song, but it cracks me up. The idea of flourishing arena rockers with white jeans and Farrah Fawcett hair singing about the plight of a hapless Joe who can only _aspire_ to blue-collar status seems ludicrous. But then again it was 1978, so most of Styx’s audience consisted of ordinary working dudes with white jeans and Farrah Fawcett hair. Styx were always about offering their crowd a reassuring pat on the back (see also “The Grand Illusion”), and here they do it with a burning keyboard riff forged in the Heep mold. Very ’eavy and very ’umble indeed.
