Not gonna lie, these Swedes sucked me in with their bizarre band name. I’m not sure if there was actually a movie in which The Man in the Iron Mask leads a sedan-driving rat gang…but a quick Google search strictly points to **Jeremy Irons & the Ratgang Malibus**. I would not be surprised if they were called something else on their next album; after all, there’s a reason why Alterbeast is no longer known as Gary Busey Amber Alert. ;)

That said, these dudes definitely don’t play technical death metal. Think post-rock mixed with heavy psych, which makes the Jeremy Irons connection all the more perplexing. _Spirit Knife_ starts off with “Fog by the Steep,” which begins with some bluesy guitar noodling before the band comes in with a wallop somewhat akin to latter-day Neurosis—except that Scott Kelly never hit these high notes! But they take a psychedelic detour towards the end of the tune, which continues onto subsequent tracks.

“Sworn Collision” belies its name by being a softer ballad, with some slowly ringing riffs meandering beneath somewhat clean vocals. Likewise, “Once Levitated” doesn’t make much noise; it's a laid-back bluesy number that seems somewhat akin to Dead Meadow jamming on Classics IV (first time you’ll see that name in a review here, I’m sure). But “Clang” brings back the rock with a driving, organ-driven number that has shades of Rush and Led Zep without quite sounding like either. I dunno man, maybe it’s just the vocals…

Alas, while this album does have its heavier moments, I think I expected something with Jeremy Irons’ name on it to be a bit more bad ass.
