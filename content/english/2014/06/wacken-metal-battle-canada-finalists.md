## Wacken Metal Battle Canada Finalists 2014

### Burning the Day

**Who are you and where are you from? (who plays what, hometown)**

My name is Matt and I'm one of the guitarists from **Burning The Day**. We also have Cesar Silva (vocals), Dmitri Skribans (bass), Maxim Shelkov (guitar), and Steve "The Animal" Mitchell (on drums).

**What's your niche?**

We have lot's of fast melodic riffs mixed with groovy syncopated breakdowns and I think what makes us distinct is how tight we are from playing all these songs thousands of times.

**Why metal? What's your favourite thing about the genre, the scene, the culture?**

Metal is what we all listened to growing up with bands like Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, In Flames, etc. ... so many bands to name. I think the metal culture has the best and most die hard fans compared to any other genre of music. I don't think you would see too many Cold Play tattoos, but you would see lots of Slayer tattoos and a kid that carved it into his arm with a knife.

**Who or what inspires you?**

Our biggest inspiration comes from the bands that we listened to that made us want to start playing in the first place.  Metallica and Pantera are the two best metal bands of all time, and I think most metalheads would agree with that. Without these bands, there would be no Burning The Day.

**#1 motivation for competing in Wacken Metal Battle Canada?**

The motivation is simply to play at Wacken Festival and be crowned best independent metal band in Canada. It would be an honor and dream come true to play Wacken and we are extremely excited to be a part of it.

**Highlight of this year's competition so far (besides getting to the finals)?**

The best highlight was having a list of 100 metal bands to go check out and listen to and getting to meet new bands and make new friends.

### Exit Strategy

**Who are you and where are you from?**

We are **Exit Strategy** from Calgary, Alberta. Members are Wes LeLeeuw on vocals, Joe Sikorski on guitar, Greg Musgrave on bass & vocals and Casey Rogers on drums.

\[caption id="attachment\_16030" align="alignleft" width="150"\][![Exit Strategy](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Exit-Strategy-150x150.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Exit-Strategy.jpg) Exit Strategy\[/caption\]

**What's your niche?**

We have kind of dubbed our sound as 'Deathgrind', which is basically a hybrid of death metal & grindcore. There are a lot more hooks and groove elements in our music that is not overly common in death metal and most certainly not in grindcore, which is one of the key elements of our sound that tends to distinguish us from our peers. We also approach the vocals with a lead vocalist and then a secondary vocalist. This gives the music and live show a distinctive dynamic that sets us apart and gives us the opportunity to explore tandem and cross-vocalization which seems to resonate with our fans.

**Why metal? What's your favourite thing about the genre, the scene, the culture?**

Metal is in all of our blood and is as thick as it gets. All of us in this band have been doing this for many years and have always been very passionate about the metal scene as a whole and the community that comes with being in a metal band. There are very few genres of music where the music defines you above all other characteristics, and image, looks, age are just an added bonus. Those things are of course important, but if the music doesn't hold its own, then you are dead in the water before you even get off shore.

**Who or what inspires you?**

This band really has one of the broadest cross-sections of influences from any group of musicians that I've ever worked with. Our vocalist is into a lot of backwoods blues and dark folk stuff to crazy hyper-speed stuff like Fleshgod Apocalypse; the guitarist has huge death metal influences with bands like Cryptopsy and Suffocation being major contributors to his writing style but he also loves prog bands like Pain Of Salvation and Porcupine Tree; our drummer holds Meshuggah next to godliness; and I am into more experimental bands like Dog Fashion Disco, Mr Bungle and Faith No More. So collectively we all bring a lot of different influences to the table and that cross-section of influences comes out in the music and contributes to what we believe is a very different take on the typical death metal sound.

**#1 motivation for competing in Wacken Metal Battle Canada?**

To hopefully go all the way to playing Wacken in Germany, which would be beyond a dream, and to be heard by as many people as possible and for the band to hopefully make it to the next proverbial level, so to speak.

**Highlight of this year's competition so far (besides getting to the finals)?**

The highlight has really been the show attendance and support that the local Alberta scene has shown – the people that have come out to support all of the bands throughout the entire competition and the fact that we have such a strong and resilient metal scene. The support for all of the shows has been nothing short of incredible.

### My Hollow

**Who are you and where are you from?**

On guitars we have Greg Gallagher from Leamington, Ontario and Lenny Chiasson from Etobicoke, Ontario. On bass we got Sean De Faria from Mississauga, Ontario. Banging the drums is Angelo Giammattolo from Bolton, Ontario and on the mic we got Graham Gaudreault from Cranbrook, BC.

**What's your niche?**

Overall with all the sub genres these days under the umbrella of metal, we placed ourselves in the progressive-groove metal pile. We make efforts of working on ways to stand out from other bands to make people remember us at the end of the night and the following day via stage presence with unforgettable choreographed action coupled with our distinctive sound.

**Why metal? What's your favourite thing about the genre, the scene, the culture?**

We feel that this genre of music is on par with what we enjoy and listen to ourselves so it's the greatest thing for us to create music that speaks from where our hearts are. There's no replacing the crowds that are attracted to this music and how it makes people react and there's no better feeling than seeing a packed house go nuts and feed off their energy!

**Who or what inspires you?**

Luckily for us, we had the pleasure of playing with a lot of great bands who are signed and have completely got their stuff together, which in turn gave us the drive to improve ourselves all across the board. We have those experiences to thank for a lot that we have learned since playing shows with those acts and we will continue to learn and grow as a unit.

**#1 motivation for competing in Wacken Metal Battle Canada?**

We have to say a major pull factor to this competition was the magnitude of it being Canadian wide and the attention that this battle draws. After hearing about how well it went last year there was no doubt that we had to enter and try our hand in this epic event which holds potentially "the greatest" grand prize of any competition near its category.

**Highlight of this year's competition so far (besides getting to the finals)?**

There's many aspects of the greatness that comes with being a part of this battle and can't be narrowed to one highlight so far for us. We have gained a ton of exposure from playing with these other bands and at these shows hosted by this tournament. You simply can't pay for what a band can gain from all of this. From interviews to blogs to professional photos to new fans and being judged and moving on to the finals, this entire competition has been a major advantage for us a band. We are honored to be a part of this battle and to make it to the finals and hopefully we can represent our amazing country in Germany. We thank everyone involved and look forward to rockin with you's in the future!

### MUTANK

**Who are you and where are you from?**

Stephen: WE ARE **MUTANK**! We're a thrash happy accident waiting to happen based out of Montreal QC. First up is the metronomercy Ahmed "On Meds" Saad on drums. Next we've got the guitarded weirdo and rhythm guitarist du jour Steven "Steve-In" Breen. Can't forget the head shredder who'll turn you into a bed wetter Lee Whiskey. And I'm Stephen "Steve-out" Reynolds on the bass and vocals, and I'm kinda cool too.

**What's your niche?**

We play thrash metal/crossover in the vein of D.R.I., Municipal Waste, Insanity Alert etc. but we often get compared to early Metallica and Slayer. Our signature is a fusion of the brutal with the fun. You can mosh, headbang, dance or just stand around looking tough when we play and no one will take issue. We also like to add a bit of stand-up comedy to our sets so people can have a laugh before they beat the crap our of each other.

**Why metal? What's your favourite thing about the genre, the scene, the culture?**

I could probably spend all day answering this question. For me one of the main draws as a songwriter is the fact that metal is one of the only places you can really talk about anything, and there is still a lot left to say. As a fan I see a lot of bands being successful that I don't think do the genre and the community justice and that's something we intend to rectify. Also, this is what I've done since I was 12, it's what I'm best at and it's what I will always do no matter what the circumstance.

**Who or what inspires you?**

My best inspiration has always come when I'm in some extreme emotional state, whether it be euphoric or suicidal. It also tends to happen when I either hear music I absolutely love down to the last tiny detail (i.e. _Rust in Peace_) or when I hear music that infuriates me with its insolence (i.e. almost anything being played on top 40 radio). Either one makes me feel the need to sprint to my guitar and start putting a song together.

**#1 motivation for competing in Wacken Metal Battle Canada?**

It's simple, we just want to play more shows. If they happen to be in other countries in front of a crap-ton of people, it's all gravy!

**Highlight of this year's competition so far (besides getting to the finals)?**

Just seeing the support among the bands and the fans, the good sportsmanship and the killer lineups that were put together due to the competition that we got to be a part of. We are a very new band – we're only about a year old and to be given this opportunity, even just to play in the competition at all, is huge for us. Winning is nice too though.

### Neck of the Woods

**Who are you and where are you from?**

We are **Neck of the Woods** from Vancouver BC. Dave Carr and Travis Hein on guitars, Cam King on bass, Jeff Brown on Drums and Jeff Radomsky on vocal duty.

**[![NOTW 2014](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/NOTW-2014-150x150.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/NOTW-2014.jpg)What's your niche?**

NOTW is a dynamic metal band in terms of sound. Naturally we have heavy parts but we also have clean passages that give the listener a chance to reassemble their brain. It keeps things interesting. We also incorporate odd time signatures and dual guitar harmonies, riffs that are fun to play and make you want to rock out.

**Why metal? What's your favourite thing about the genre, the scene, the culture?**

It's no secret that some of the most proficient musicians play metal. The genre allows you to push yourself musically, technically, and become an overall better player while you're at it. Also, everyone loves an intense live show! Currently in Vancouver, the scene is alive and well. Every Saturday night you can head to one of the usual venues and catch a rad show. You'll run into your friends, other bands, promoters... it's awesome. Everyone is supportive of one another and usually down for a couple beers too.

**Who or what inspires you?**

Musically, bands like Between the Buried and Me, Opeth and Animals as Leaders... bands that really push the envelope while doing whatever they want at the same time. Living in a beautiful place like BC helps too.

**#1 motivation for competing in Wacken Metal Battle Canada?**

Aside from the obvious, (shredding Germany) it was the chance for exposure. Our first show as only four months ago, we're still a relatively new band. Making it to the finals has really helped us get our name out there.

**Highlight of this year's competition so far (besides getting to the finals)?**

Playing two rad venues in Vancouver: round #4 at The Venue on Granville, and the Vancouver finals at The Rickshaw.
