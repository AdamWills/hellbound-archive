It's staff playlist time again! Check out the most recent picks (though not necessarily for recent music) from Hellbound's staff. Some are fall themed, or tuned in to the celebratory long weekend of Canadian Thanksgiving (perhaps even Oktoberfest). Others, well, we picked 'em just because we like 'em. Keep reading to get the scoop on what's been pleasing our ears.

Happy Thanksgiving, turkey-mongers! The powers that be at Hellbound said they were looking for an October-themed playlist, and it just happened to work out that a lot of what I happened to be listening to lately was released in – surprise! – October, or at least very late September. Here's some of the stuff I liked best on my turntable/CD player/mp3 player lately, in no particular order:

**Coheed and Cambria** - _In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3_ (vinyl reissue, Columbia/Equal Vision/Sony Music/Legacy): While no fan would claim that this new vinyl reissue is the best laid out piece of wax they've ever seen (one part, Velourium ends up on the flipside of the other two, for example, and "2113" is the only track on Side D), the remastering job done and resulting fidelity/quality of sound is phenomenal. **Electric Wurms** - _Musik, die Schwer zu Twerk EP_ (Warner Brothers) ([groundcontrolmag.com/detail/9/3947/1/](http://groundcontrolmag.com/detail/9/3947/1/)) **Death From Above 1979** - _The Physical World_ ([groundcontrolmag.com/detail/9/3946/1/](http://groundcontrolmag.com/detail/9/3946/1/)) **Gary Clark Jr.** - Live (Warner Brothers) ([groundcontrolmag.com/detail/3/3964/](http://groundcontrolmag.com/detail/3/3964/)) **The Melvins** - Hold It In (Ipecac) ([groundcontrolmag.com/detail/3/3959/](http://groundcontrolmag.com/detail/3/3959/))

Autumn is my favourite season. The harvest comes in, the leaves are changing, crisp mornings make you feel alive and this handful of killer albums soundtrack the shortening of days.

**ALUNAH** – _Awakening the Forest_ (Napalm): An awakening in the Fall may not seem right but I've been waking up with the title track to this excellent doom album in my head for weeks. Big riffs, sweet melodies and Soph Day's powerful vocals ensure I'll be spinning this long after the snow flies. Suited for whiskey mornings and fans of Witch Mountain. ([www.alunah.co.uk](http://www.alunah.co.uk/))

**ANCIENT VVISDOM** – _Sacrificial_ (Magic Bullet): Who knew the occult and Satanism could sound so inviting? Dark themes dominate Ancient VVisdom's work but the music and vocals are loaded with magical melody and hooks. “Chaos Will Reign” and “Devil's Work” are particularly endearing. Suited for midnight rituals and subconscious indoctrination. ([soundcloud.com/earsplit/ancient-vvisdom-chaos-will-reign/s-H1qyg](http://soundcloud.com/earsplit/ancient-vvisdom-chaos-will-reign/s-H1qyg))

**WINTERFYLLETH** – _The Divination of Antiquit_y (Candlelight): Sure, it has Winter in the name and not Autumn or Fall but this album is outstanding. Love of land and lore bleed into every facet of the album. Soaring melodies and relentlessness ripen over and hour and six minutes (with the bonus track on the digipack) of stellar black metal. Beauty, power and reverence make for a captivating listen. Suited for spirited jogs in the forest or travelling through time. ([candlelightrecordsusa.bandcamp.com/album/the-divination-of-antiquity](https://candlelightrecordsusa.bandcamp.com/album/the-divination-of-antiquity))

**ORANGE GOBLIN** – _Back From the Abyss_ (Candlelight): With Halloween right around the corner how could I not mention a new album from Orange Goblin? The UK stoner rockers are back at it and just as potent as ever. Biker blooze and easy breezy riffs back Big Ben's coarse throat. With OG you know what you're getting and _Back From the Abyss_ holds back the tricks and serves up the treats. Suited for knockin' back some pumpkin beers and getting a groove on.

**PRIMORDIAL** – “Where Greater Men Have Fallen” (Metal Blade): The album isn't out until late November but Metal Blade put up a lyric video for the title track. If you know Primordial then you know you're gonna get some epic stuff. If the album is anything like this track, and I bet it is, the Irish folkened black metal legends will further cement their legacy with powerful and uplifting music. Those more privileged than I are saying it's fantastic. Suited for conquest and proudly contemplating Irish heritage.

**Woods of Ypres** - "Outro: The End of August" (Krankenhaus Records): While it's well past the end of August, the final track of Woods II is a grand conclusion to a great Canadian album, reflecting upon the final days of the warm summer and into the crisp cooling autumnal airs. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahpD84sY8g0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahpD84sY8g0)) **Type O Negative** - _October Rust_ (Roadrunner): Impossible (and unnecessary) to single out a single track, there is no better soundtrack to the month than _October Rust_. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQXrJ2EpNM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQXrJ2EpNM)) **Drudkh** - _Autumn Aurora_ (Supernal): Atmospheric black metal at it's best, Drudkh's Autumn Aurora is a must listen to for any season, but especially hits a nerve during the harvest months. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yf3eyXhlwg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yf3eyXhlwg)) **November's Doom** - _The Pale Haunt Departure_ (The End): One of the most consistent doom bands, November's Doom popped onto my radar with The Pale Haunt Departure, and have been a fan ever since. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnAqqt7DunM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnAqqt7DunM)) **Opeth** - Blackwater Park (Music for Nations): While some say that Opeth's breakthrough album is _Still Life_, _Blackwater Park_ is the album that turned me on to the band and I can think of few better songs than "Harvest" as the perfect soundtrack to the season.
