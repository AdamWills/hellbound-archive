**BLOOD CEREMONY** with **VOLUR** at the Trash Palace in Toronto on April 19th 2014

**Photos and recap by Danielle Griscti**

Yes, the _Trash Palace_ Cinema.  Toronto's **Blood Ceremony** held an intimate show supported by **Völur**, playing early in the evening and screening a classic horror film from the venue's vault afterwards.  Despite the early set times, the small space was quickly filled with an interesting mix of people from a variety of different musical backgrounds.  The genre-crossing appeal of these two bands is easy to see in the refreshingly diverse, and ever growing, crowds of fans at their powerfully heavy and energetic live performances.

**Völur** first shot up on the radar a few months ago when I happened upon them playing live at The Cage in Toronto.  Doom with a decidedly pagan influence, something seemed so familiar that first time listening to the combination of vocals, an ongoing low chant and entrancing, warm accompaniment creating a dark harmony.  With the pure resonance of a six-string violin piercing through the heaviness, enhancing it, intertwining with the commanding riffs and controlled drumming, they had me hooked.   Their first release, _Disir_ has just been made available through their bandcamp, and I look forward to hearing it and how their already captivating sound develops.

(note: the reason they looked so familiar was _[https://hellbound.ca/2013/09/blood-ceremony-biblical-cauchemar-horseshoe-tavern-toronto-on-september-14-2013](https://hellbound.ca/2013/09/blood-ceremony-biblical-cauchemar-horseshoe-tavern-toronto-on-september-14-2013)_)

**Blood Ceremony** are just embarking on a European tour, and from the electric atmosphere of this set, I have no doubt that every night will be an unforgettable performance.  When a listener gets to  experience their combination of psychedelic rock, doom and folk components, with vocalist Alia deftly weaving between her keyboard and flute, the overall effect is a lot of different things – fun, engaging, headbang-inducing (of course) and just irresistible.  For lack of a better term, I'll use crowd-pleaser, because tracks like “Goodbye Gemini” with its immensely catchy hooks are exactly that.  Below is a glimpse of the experience:
