New album _The Serpent & The Sphere_ out from Profound Lore May 13th: [http://www.profoundlorerecords.com/agalloch-complete-work-on-new-album/](http://www.profoundlorerecords.com/agalloch-complete-work-on-new-album/)

New track "Celestial Effigy" streaming link: [http://agalloch.bandcamp.com/album/the-serpent-the-sphere](http://agalloch.bandcamp.com/album/the-serpent-the-sphere)

Soaring and epically beautiful, what longtime fans know as the standard from Portland, Oregon's AGALLOCH. From 1999's _Pale Folklore_Â their sound has often invoked the atmosphere of a dark forest; this track follows that path as well. Accompanying you on the journey are the sometimes softly whispered, sometimes ferally growled vocals of John Haughm and crisp, precise drumming from Aesop Dekker (also of WORM OUROBOROS) to round out the captivating effect.
