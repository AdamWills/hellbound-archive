You can judge **Final Gate Records**' latest split from the cover. It’s a skeletal sepulchral party in full occult swing, done in pen 'n’ ink scratching à la Mark Riddick. Musically it’s the same – this is Old Skool Death Metal worship at the altar of Incantation, so if that sounds like fun, take gulp from the chalice.

**Graveyard Ghoul** and **Cryptic Brood** are young German bands, and each offers three songs. Everything is covered in cemetery grime so thick that anything not razor-sharp is buried. The bass hasn’t been exhumed, but there’s enough rattle and boom in the \[lack of\] production to bang your head to when the volume’s up. There are riffs – lots of them, some pretty good — and a bunch of grunting about nightmare ceremonies. Graveyard Ghoul has a serious doom inflection, and Cryptic Brood aren’t all that different, but with more of a booming rasp to the high end and some hollowed vocals.

Decent stuff, and it will be fun to see what both bands offer on their promised full lengths in 2015.
