It says a lot for **The Oath** that their music actually matches the images created by the album’s cover. I’ve seen this album described as occult rock, but that’s beginning to become a catch-all term, it’s meaning worn out by over-use. Rather, to my experienced ears this a great modern take on the new wave of British heavy metal. I can hear **Tygers of Pan Tang**, **Witchfinder General**, **Venom**, and of course, the mighty **Angel Witch**!

This is as it should be - all superb bands, just waiting for a modern reinterpretation. The band’s two main members, Johanna Sadonis on vocals and Linnea Olsson on guitars, both superb musicians, give The Oath a unique identity. Their song-writing is absolutely perfect. This is a band with a huge appreciation of all that has come before.

Sadly, The Oath broke up before their self-titled debut was released, but it remains a beautiful piece of metal art, and I can only hope that both ladies make more music in the future. Their talents are too good to be wasted.
