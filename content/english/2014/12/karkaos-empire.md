I had not heard of the intriguingly named **Karkaos** before and this is a shame as they are a pretty decent band.

Musically, the band are very adroit; they sound like a cross between Arch Enemy and Dimmu Borgir but with a twist of their own.

What really gives them a strong identity of their own is the voice of Veronica Ortiz Rodriguez. Moving from a whisper to a scream, she has an astonishing vocal range – really the contrast between melody and a primal roar is very impressive. _\[ed.'s note  – after parting ways with Rodriguez, Karkaos introduced new vocalist Viky Boyer on October 15, 2014\]_

As a constructive criticism, I’d say a bit more variety in the music wouldn’t go amiss. It doesn’t always have to be epic; sometimes short and to the point breaks up an album nicely.

But overall, a pleasant surprise and a band we’ll be hearing more from in the future.
