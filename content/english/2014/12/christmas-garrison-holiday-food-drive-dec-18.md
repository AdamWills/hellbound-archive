It's not metal but it's for a good cause. If you're in the mood for burlesque, 50s and 60s music, and supporting the Daily Bread food bank, you might want to check out "Christmas at the Garrison."

Here's the scoop:

"_Christmas at the Garrison_ is an annual holiday food drive where 100% of the proceeds go directly to the Daily Bread Food Bank. We bring together local bands, DJs and burlesque acts for a fun holiday party at which we can also give back to our community! This year we have **Bangs & Blush** DJing ([http://www.bangsandblush.ca/](http://www.bangsandblush.ca/)) and Toronto burlesque babes **The Harlettes** ([https://www.facebook.com/TheHarlettes](https://www.facebook.com/TheHarlettes)), as well as Phil Guerrero (of YTV) who hosts the event every year. All participants involved, including the Garrison, generously donate 100% of their time, talents and facilities to this worthy cause. And of course, with support from local sponsors such as Mill Street Brewery, Le Select Bistro, Garrison's Barbershop and Kops Records, we hope to make this an amazing event for those who wish to give back this holiday season!"

This is the fourth time around. If you're interested in digging into the event's history, check out this feature in the _Toronto Star_: [http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2011/12/23/a\_big\_gift\_from\_heaven.html](http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2011/12/23/a_big_gift_from_heaven.html).

For those of you outside Toronto, I'm sure your local foodbank could use some support as well. Here in Hellbound's homebase – Hamilton, Ontario – one of the ways you can help out is by donating to Hamilton Food Share: [www.hamiltonfoodshare.org](http://www.hamiltonfoodshare.org).
