Previously only available in Finland, and now unleashed on the world by Svart Records.

The songs are well crafted, and while diverse, have a dark majesty all of their own. It owes something to vocalist Vil’s previous band, the splendidly named **Babylon Whores**, though I have to say **Sleep of Monsters** is a great name, and I love the references to Goya.

This is a smart, talented band, and with _Produces Reason_ they could cross over to a very wide audience indeed.
