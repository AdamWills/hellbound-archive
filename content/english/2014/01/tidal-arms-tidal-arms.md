**By Gruesome Greg**

Although their self-titled is actually the second album from this Brooklyn-based trio, it happens to be their first that I’ve actually heard.  Can I just say props for having a song named “Jelloshotgun”?  I could use one of those…

Anyways, what we’ve got here are 10 tracks of angly, jangly, mathy post-metal that might appeal to fans of NeurIsis and their ilk, not to mention Zoroaster and bands like Lint on the math-rock side.  Although this semi-obscure subgenre sometimes sounds sorta samey, there is enough variety and dynamics here to hold my interest for a mere 41-and-a-half minutes.  The shorter song lengths certainly help.

As for “Jelloshotgun,” it starts out as a bright, airy, three-minute pop-punk tune, albeit with a couple doomy breakdowns thrown in for good measure, before veering off into mathy instrumental territory, similar to thisquietarmy or one of those other bands that used to share bills with Nadja.  Go figure!
