The 2nd edition of Hammaburg Fest and the 7th of Elbriot Festival took place right in the heart of German city Hamburg, with the wholesale market halls of Grossmarkt as backdrop on, respectively, Friday 16th and Saturday 17th August 2019.

## **Hammaburg Fest**

In 2018 the organisers of Elbriot Festival come up with a new festival- **Hammaburg Fest** which was taking place a day before Elbriot at the same location and in its first year was focusing on medieval rock and metal. Hammaburg Fest's debut in the festival world started with four German bands: medieval metal band In Extremo, heavy metal five- piece Die Apokalyptischen Reiter, and medieval folk rockers Schandmaul and Feuerschwanz.

After a successful first year, the second edition of Hammaburg Fest was leading us this time down the memory lane with 80s and 90s style music.

Headlining Hammaburg Fest this year was a band that came out of the British post-punk scene in early 80s – British rockers **Sisters of Mercy**. Their synth pop infused melodies were not exactly everyone's cup of tea and some festival goers left few songs into the set, however those who stayed were treated to an impressive show. Clouds of dry ice floating across the stage mixing with colourful light beams resulted in an atmospheric show and the enigmatic Sisters frontman Andrew Eldritch with an emotionless stare behind his dark shades flanked by bandmates Ben Christo and Chris Catalyst was getting through all the bands most popular tunes.

## Elbriot

Elbriot, with a list of big names on the bill, is obviously a lot more popular than Hammaburg Fest, however for its space the event felt very crowded. It was very hard to move around and the queues for food were very long. But since the festival will be relocating next year due to construction works in the area, let's hope the organizers will be able to find a nice and spacious location. Great selection of food and drinks though – there was even a nice little cocktail and wine bar. Most importantly, though, everyone around, including security and crew,  was really nice, exchanging smiles , always up for a little chat and enjoying the music.

Elbriot festival this year had a late start with word going around that theatrical heavy metal act **Avatar** would not be able to perform since their gear truck on the way to Hamburg got into a car accident. Luckily though no one was injured and the band's gear was not damaged either. That was bad news for many of the festival goers since many of them were really looking forward to seeing the Swedish band.

 The festival's headliners this year were heavy metallers **In Flames**. The Swedes released their latest album _I, the Mask_ on 1 March this year and Elbriot was the last stop on their long summer festival list. A large number of songs in the hour and half long set were coming from the band's latest release, and despite the rain fans covered in waterproofs were singing along.
