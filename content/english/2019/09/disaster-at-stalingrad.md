## Disaster At Stalingrad: An Alternative History

### By Peter G. Tsouras

### Foreword by Ralph Peters

#### Published by Frontline Books

In September 1942, the German commander of the Sixth Army, General Paulus, supported by the Fourth Panzer Army, was poised to advance on the Russian city of Stalingrad, with the objective to bypass and cut off this important centre of communications and manufacturing on the western bank of the Volga, to facilitate the fall of the Caucasus oil fields.

Then, Hitler, never a master strategist, interfered. He wanted the city that bore the name of his enemy Stalin captured.

On this did the entire war in the East pivot. Prior to Stalingrad the German advance had been unstoppable. After Stalingrad, the Germans were driven back to Berlin and ruin.

But Peter G. Tsouras sees it could have been otherwise, with some minor but totally plausible adjustments..

In this thought-provoking book, this former soldier and military intelligence expert shows just how it might have gone.

He is a fine writer and this book is hard to put downâ€¦ and it has some ending!
