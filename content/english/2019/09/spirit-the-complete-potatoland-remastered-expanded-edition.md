It’s fair to say, such an album as this could only have been created in the 1970s. Guitarist Randy California had departed from Spirit in the early 70s and ‘_Potatoland_’ (or to give it its full title, _The Adventures of Kaptain Kopter and Commander Cody in Potatoland_), was originally to be a solo album but mutated into a Spirit album.

It’s fair to say Cherry Red have done a sterling job with this box set and no more complete version of ‘_Potatoland_’ could possibly exist. For Spirit fans and fans of psychedelic rock in general, this is a fascinating release that will provide many hours and intriguing musical adventures.
