## Charles Dickens' Unfinished Novel and Our Endless Attempts To End It

### Published by Pen & Sword History

Charles Dickens dies on the 9th of June 1870, halfway through the writing of _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_.

From that point onward, a great many writers have attempted to finish Drood.

This fine book tells the tale of these many attempts though as the author rightfully notes:

> “That Dickens left his final book unfinished need not be a source of frustration, but the ultimate parting word from an author who built his career on his relationship with his reading public ...”

As always, Pen & Sword have done a fine job with the illustrations, particularly the highly original work of Alys Jones.

A fine book for anyone with an interest in Dickens in general and Drood in particular.
