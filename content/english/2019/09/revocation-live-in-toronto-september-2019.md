## Revocation, Voivod, Psycroptic, Skeletal Remains & Conjurer

### @ The Opera House, Toronto ON, 14 September 2019

As the night started, a queue wrapped around the building with metal fans coming together to watch a legendary lineup, you could guarantee it would be a night to remember. From the first sound check all the way to the crowd cheering for more at the end, **Revocation, Voivod, Psycroptic, Skeletal Remains** and **Conjurer** made the night as brutal as one could only imagine.

Hailing from the UK, **Conjurer** started the evening off with the raw sound of the vocals being projected throughout the venue sans microphone and ending their set with the bassist jumping off the stage to continue to play with a full mosh pit surrounding him. **Skeletal Remains** proceeded to remind metal fans of their brutal intensity that they are best known for. With a tremendous performance of technical and high energy vocals **Psycroptic** delivered a flawless show with guest vocalist Jason Keyser of Origin.

Coming home to Canada, you couldn’t help but notice how excited the legendary **Voivod** were to be playing for Toronto fans after decades of performing. The crowd was full of movement and singing along with Denis Belanger (Snake), who took fans from the 80’s all the way to 2018 with their latest hits from their 14th studio album, _The Wake_.

 To celebrate the release of their recent album _The Outer Ones,_ **Revocation** played the album in its entirety. The crowd screamed for more as they moshed and cheered along to the dark sci-fi lyrics and face melting guitar solos. They took time to pay homage to _Dungeons and Dragons_ before breaking into “Blood Atonment” and continuing to blow the crowd's minds with their phenomenal stage presence.
