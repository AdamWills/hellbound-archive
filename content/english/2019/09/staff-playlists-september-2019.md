Another round of staff playlists from the folks at Hellbound. This is what we've been spinning as summer turns to fall (in the northern hemisphere, anyway).

* * *

## Hellbound recommends

### Steve Earles

**1\.**  **New release:** The Steve Howe Trio - _New Frontier._ Music played with love, as it should be.

**Live:**  Zealot Cult @ Dolans Limerick. Ireland's best kept metal secret... not for much longer. Legends in waiting.

**Non-Metal:** Gerry Rafferty - _Who Knows What The Day Will bring?_ Just one of the greatest songwriters ever.

**Wild card:** Orbital's _Event Horizon_ soundtrack. Far superior to the film it accompanies, you have never heard anything this weird and wonderful, like the BBC Radiophonic Workshop jamming with the Royal Philharmonic. It's a shame the film and it's exciting concept (spaceship travels to Hell and returns) can't live up to the sublime score, but do check this out, pop-pickers, it's splendid.

**2\. New Release:**  Darkthrone - _Old Star_

**Live:**  Kingwitch @ Dolans Limerick. A truly superb band.

**Non-metal:** The Beatles - _Yellow Submarine_

**Wildcard:** _Waterloo_ by Bernard Cornwell. Proably the most readable account of the battle on account of the writer's skills as a storyteller.

### Arta Gailuma

**1.** **Listening to:** Prognosis [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-qFiRT9PYU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-qFiRT9PYU)

**Live:** Sick of it All headlining the second stage at Into The Grave Festival. 

**2.** **Listening to:** Voyager [https://voyager.bandcamp.com/](https://voyager.bandcamp.com/)

**New release**: Cult of Luna - _A Dawn to Fear_

**Live:** Coldbones. Plenty of other great and bigger bands I've seen lately, but this was a new discover. [https://coldbonesuk.bandcamp.com/](https://coldbonesuk.bandcamp.com/)

### Gene Gaona

**Listening to:** The Doors - _L.A. Woman_

**New Release:** Gatecreeper - _Deserted_ (Relapse Records, October 4th, 2019) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLFAmWeCz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLFAmWeCzRk)

### Danielle Griscti

**Listening to:** Digging on the tasty riffs of Darkthrone - _Old Star_

**New release:** The savage Immortal Bird - _Thrive on Neglect_

**Live:** It's been an amazing season for live shows, I'll have to use this space to say Iron Maiden are still untouchable.  More on this later.  

**Non-metal:** Just in time for the best season of the year, spooktacular Slasher Dave - _The Creaking Door_ [https://youtu.be/BugjEPC1oMI](https://youtu.be/BugjEPC1oMI)

**Wild card:** This has been getting regular nighttime listens, Castel Jaloux - Le petit orchestre de la nuit [https://casteljaloux.bandcamp.com/album/le-petit-orchestre-de-la-nuit](https://casteljaloux.bandcamp.com/album/le-petit-orchestre-de-la-nuit)

### Gruesome Greg

**1\.** **Listening to:** Acid King - _Busse Woods_

**New release:** Orodruin - _Ruins of Eternity_

**Live:** Brant Bjork @ Lee's Palace, Sept 25th; Nashville Pussy @ Horseshoe Tavern, Sept 26th; Acid King @ Mohawk Place (Buffalo), Sept 28th.

**Non-Metal:** Currently watching Ken Burns' Country Music doc series on PBS.

**Wild card:** Hoping that Dak Prescott is the real deal -- he's now the starting QB on my fantasy football team.

**2.** **New release:** Chron Goblin - _Here Before_

**Live:** Pagan Altar w/ Blood Ceremony, Cauchemar, Smoulder @ Lee's Palace, August 24

**Non-Metal:** Margo Price - _Midwest Farmer's Daughter_ 

**Wild card:** Currently browsing the film schedule for TIFF. Lotsa movies about cults and Nazis this year!

### Keith Lloyd

**Listening to****:** Onslaught - _Killing Peace._ Discovered this gem through pure chance. Filled with enough thrashy bangers to make yer 'ead spin.

**New release:** VHS - _We're Going to Need Some Bigger Riffs._ I find extreme metal always pairs best with a good sense of humor (See Zimmer's Hole) Matt Harvey of Exhumed makes a great guest appearance.

**Live:** Iron Maiden Legacy of the Beast tour 2019 - Hands down the best show I've ever seen. Singing along to fear of the dark in a sold out arena was a childhood dream come true.

**Non-Metal:** Bridge City Sinners - _Here's to the Devil_ : Great collection of folk punk inspired tunes.

**Wild card:** _Pygmy_ by Chuck Palahniuk - another great book from one of my favourite authors. 

### Sarah Riley

**Listening to:** Angel Witch - _Gorgon_ (Angel Witch, Bronze Records, 1980). Definitely been feeling the classics lately.

**New release:** Becomes Astral - _Conman._ [https://b](https://becomesastral.bandcamp.com/track/conman)[ecomesastral.bandcamp.com/track/conman](https://becomesastral.bandcamp.com/track/conman)

**Live:** Conjurer, Skeletal Remains, Psycroptic, Voivod, Revocation @ The Opera House, Toronto, September 14th. Sweet line up, good friends and David Davidson of Revocation serenading my soul. I can't say it gets much better than that.

**Non-Metal:** The Gun Club - _Mother of Earth._ (Miami, Animal Records, 1982)

A good buddy of mine showed me this record a few months back and honestly, a psychobilly band was something I never knew I needed in my life.

**Wild card:** Recently found out that Top Gun Burger in Kensington Market is unquestionably flavourtown. Soooo good.

### Daniel Smith

**1.** **Listening to**: Leviathan - _Scar Sighted_

**New release:** Diocletian - _Amongst the Flames of a Burning God_

**Live:** Quebec Deathfest, Sept 13 & 14 (Possessed, Triptykon, Nuclear Assault, Cancer, Chthe'ilist)

**Non-Metal:** Denzl Curry - ZUU

**Wild card:** Apocalypse Now: The Final Cut in theaters

**2\. L****istening to:** Blood Incantation - _Starspawn_

**New release:** Blut Aus Nord - _Hallucinogen_ 

**Live:** Quebec Deathfest 2 - Montreal - Sept 13, 14

**Non-Metal:** Charli XCX - _Charli_

**Wild card:** _Ad Astra_ film by James Gray

### Adam Wills

**Listening to:** Leprous - _Alleviate_ ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eFq16CXSU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eFq16CXSU))

**New release:** Weeping Sores - _False Confession_ ([https://weepingsores.bandcamp.com/](https://weepingsores.bandcamp.com/))

**Live:** Anneke van Giersbergen & Amorphis @ Toronto - while this wasn't my favourite performance from Amorphis (it will be hard to beat seeing them play on their home turf at Tuska), the highlight unsurprisingly was the lovely Anneke van Giersbergen. Not many people can open up a metal show with an acoustic cover of Dolly Parton and have the crowd cheering for more.

**Non-Metal:** Swiss Army Man (Original Soundtrack) - Andy Hull & Robert McDowell

**Wild card:** Jojo Rabbit (dir. Taika Waititi) ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-TdAi4FW-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-TdAi4FW-Y))
