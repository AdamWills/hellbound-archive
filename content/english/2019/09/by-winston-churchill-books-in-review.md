## Thoughts and Adventures

### Published by ISI

‘_Thoughts and Adventures_’ is rightly considered to be Churchill’s undiscovered classic.

It was written during Churchill’s ‘wilderness years’ in 1932.

Whether you like Churchill or not (and he is a polarising character to say the least), he was a superb writer. Of all the many things Churchill turned his hand to, this was an area he truly excelled at. He really wanted to communicate his thoughts and ideas and he had the ability to do so.

With a new introduction and annotations by renowned Churchill scholar James W. Muller, this book is a must for anyone with an interest, not just in Churchill, but in 20th century history.

Covering everything from ‘Cartoons and Cartoonists’ to ‘The U-Boat War’, this is an important and engaging book.

## Great Contemporaries 

### Published by ISI Books

Originally published in 1937, ‘_Great Contemporaries_’ shows Churchill’s skills as a writer to great effect.

This is the first new edition of ‘_Great Contemporaries_’ in twenty years, and includes five essays that have never appeared in any previous edition, making it indispensable for any Churchillian and again, any one with an interest in twentieth century history.

For me, the chapter on Boris Savinkov is excellent; it is a shame Churchill never wrote a book on the Russian Civil War.

Overall, a fascinating and informative read.
