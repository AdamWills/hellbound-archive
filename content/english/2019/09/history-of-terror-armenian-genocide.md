## History of Terror: Armenian Genocide: The Great Crime of World War One

### By David Charlwood

#### Published by Pen & Sword History

The Armenian Genocide is one of many things that we should have been taught at school but weren’t.

I don’t know why. I wouldn’t consider accountancy to be of greater importance than the Armenian Genocide, in which over 1.5 million Armenians were murdered by the Turkish state. The fact that the world cared so little about this evil atrocity and forgot it so quickly enabled Hitler and the Nazis to believe they could do the same to the Jews.

David Charlwood’s text is excellent: he has an intelligent economic way of telling the story of ‘Megh Yeghern’- the Great Crime, but it's the harrowing photos that really tell the story, truly disturbing and tragic. This then is what so-called ‘humanity’ is capable of descending to, and only by the truth can we guard against it happening again.

A book for those not afraid of the truth.
