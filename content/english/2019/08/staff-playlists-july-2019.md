## Hellbound recommends

Another round of staff picks and playlists from some of the folks at Hellbound. If you have your own recommendations, let us know in the comments below.

* * *

### Steve Earles

**New Release**: Darkthrone - _Old Star_. Everything just as it should be!

**Live:** Deep Purple - _Live In Europe_. Classic set from a classic band.

**Non Metal:** Rosalie Cunningham - _Rosalie Cunningham_. Former Purson singer Rosalie's debut solo album is truly superb. A star is born!

**Wild Card:** A book called _The Cosmic Serpent_ by Jermey Narby. Intriguing story of the knowledge of Shamans.

### Arta Gailuma

**Listening to:** Monuments. Getting into the mood of seeing them live again in a few days.

**New release:** Lacrimas Profundere - _Bleeding the Stars_. 26.07.2019 via SPV/Steamhammer.

**Live:** Black Tongue at Tech Fest. Have never seen these guys live before and they were incredible. The moshpit was just crazy.

### Danielle Griscti

**Listening to:** Horrendous - _Idol._

Strangely, though these Philadelphia death metal darlings have been on the radar for 7 years since their debut full-length "The Chills" in 2012, there's something about them that seems new and fresh with every release.  "Idol" is no different, and I somehow missed it last year, stumbling across it recently when ITHIEST appeared on my radar. It so happens that the expert mastering of that album was done by Horrendous frontman Damian Herring, whose growing catalogue of work as Subterranean Watchtower is nothing short of impressive.  You can peruse for your listening pleasure at [http://www.subterraneanwatchtower.com/](http://www.subterraneanwatchtower.com/), and Idol is at [https://horrendous.bandcamp.com/album/idol](https://horrendous.bandcamp.com/album/idol)

**New release:** Itheist - _Itheist._

My first thoughts on this were, this is tight and groovy af! Also, is it black metal? I still can't decide, and a full review will probably be on its way once I've digested it properly.  It was just released in June. For now though, I can say it's quite delicious, and absolutely worth a dedicated listen at [https://itheist.bandcamp.com/releases](https://itheist.bandcamp.com/releases)

**Live:** SAOR / Wayfarer / Falls of Rauros / Catacombes at Lee's Palace, Sunday July 21st.

Went for Wayfarer and Falls of Rauros, was not disappointed by any of these stellar acts.  Headliner Saor's bio best describes them, as " Caledonian Metal from Scotland inspired by heritage, nature and traditional poetry." Falls of Rauros and Wayfarer both embody the west-coast atmosphere pretty flawlessly, coming from Portland and Colorado, respectively.  Openers Catacombes, from Montreal, set the stage for a thoroughly energetic and satisfying evening.

**Non-metal:** Cabaret Nocturne.

This will be old news to those tuned in to the industrial/synthwave/dark pop bangers of the day, but, I can't stop dancin' to it, and that's a fantastic thing, late to the party or not.

**Wild card:** Cares + WHQB.

A Toronto-based collaboration of experimental intensity, beautifully on fire.  Tantalizing, bizarre, "stressful ambient" music at its finest, defying attempts at description.  An upcoming live set is on August 30th at See-Scape.

### Gruesome Greg

**Listening to:** Khemmis - _Desolation_

**New release:** Swamp Coffin - _Flatcap Bastard_. Features (bizarrely titled album from a British sludge band that worships the NOLA scene)

**Live:** Khemmis/Cloak at the Velvet Underground a couple days ago. So many upcoming shows in August and Sept, though!!!

**Non-Metal:** For some reason, I've been listening to a lot of REO Speedwagon lately…

**Wild card:** Am I the only person in Toronto who watches the CFL?

### Sarah Riley

**Listening to:**

1. Psycroptic - _A Calculated Effort_ (Observant, Nuclear Blast, 2008)
2. Gruesome - _Fragments of Psyche_ (Fragments of Psyche, Relapse Records, 2017)

**New Release:** Memoriam - _Requiem_ _for Mankind._ (June 21st, Nuclear Blast). I've definitely ran this album through more than once since its release! [https://willettsio.bandcamp.com/](https://willettsio.bandcamp.com/)

**Live:** Summer Slaughter Festival, July 28th @ The Opera House, Toronto. Great friends, some wicked bands, an insane pit and Travis Ryan of _Cattle Decapitation._ What more can a girl ask for? 

**Non-Metal:** Turnstile - _I Don't Wanna Be Blind._ (Time & Space, Roadrunner Records, 2018)

**Wild Card:** _Midsommar_ (film). Initially after watching, I thought I hated everything about this movie. But, once I couldn't stop thinking about it, I accepted that I definitely had a soft spot for that shroom-filled pagan commune. 

## Adam Wills

**Listening to**: Bruce Dickinson - Chemical Wedding (Sanctuary)

**New release:** Tomb Mold - Planetary Clairvoyance (20 Buck Spin)

**Live:** Heavy Montreal (Devin Townsend, Skálmöld, Clutch and Corrosion of Conformity highlighted the weekend)

**Non-metal:** Midsommar (Original Score) - Bobby Krlic

**Wild card:** Midsommar - dir. Ari Aster

### Laura Wiebe

**Listening to / new release**: Lacrimas Profundere - _Bleeding the Stars (_26 July 2019, SPV/Steamhammer) — _Thanks, Arta, for the head's up that this record is out._

**Live:** Heavy Montreal with a killer crew, including Adam Wills and Gene Gaona 

**Non-metal:** Maître Gims - _Ceinture noire (Transcendance)_ (2019)
