Garth Ennis and I have three things in common. We’re both Irish. We’ve both written war stories (in my case for the Eisner-nominated _[To End All Wars](https://toendallwarscomic.wordpress.com/)_ published by Soaring Penguin Press, and we both appreciate the legacy of the classic war comic _Battle_.

_Battle_ was the brainchild of writer and editor Pat Mills (Pat also created _2000 AD_, no mean feat in itself, as well as three other titles, _Diceman_, _Action_ and _Toxic_). Pat has a talent for finding the talent and using it. So, _Battle_ would feature the likes of John Wagner (_Judge Dredd_), the late great Carlos Ezquerra (one of the all-time great artists), the late artist Eric Bradbury (_Invasion 1984_ and _Death Squad_), Mike Western (whose work was seen to great effect in the classic _Battle_ story ‘The Sarge’), and the late John Cooper (who drew much of the classic _Johnny Red_ story). Without a doubt _Battle_’s greatest achievement is _Charley’s War_, written by Pat Mills and illustrated by the late Joe Colquhoun (a true original and a gifted storyteller).

_Battle_ is no longer, but its influence remains, and one of the highest compliments I can pay _The Night Witches_ is that it would fit beautifully into a 2019 version of _Battle_.

Garth Ennis has taken his 30 years experience in comics and has done excellent research (I have a huge interest in military history, especially of Russia, and I would notice if he was chancing it. He isn’t.)

_The Night Witches_ is set in World War 2, in Russia. It tells the tale of Russian pilot Anna Kharkova, one of the titular Night Witches (or Nacht Hexen as their German foes called them).

I won’t spoil the story for its readers, save to say it is beautifully written and illustrated – by the very talented Russ Braun. It truly is moving, horrifying and funny; and that makes it very real. _The Night Witches_ really is a must for anyone who appreciates a story that draws strongly on historic and universal truths. Courage will never go out of fashion not even in our fake social media world.

I know it is unlikely that Garth will ever read this review, but I say to him well done – a great achievement indeed.
