## A Collection Of Finger Lickin’ Grooves, Deep Thinkin’ Diatribes and Exploitation 45s 

Once again Cherry Red release a **_mighty fine_** collection – in this case, two CDs of classic 45s, "dug" and selected by Lux and Ivy of The Cramps. Best title of the year thus far, and as for the music – it’s amazing, unique, and you just have to dig the beat.

It would cost a fortune to source all the original 45s, so to have them in one collection, remastered, is a fine thing. All this, plus excellent sleeve notes by Mojo’s Dave Henderson. Weird, wild, and wonderful in equal measure!
