I love John Carpenter’s films and there is a great line in his classic ‘_Assault On Precinct 13_’ when Napoleon Wilson’s character says: ‘_It’s an old story, I was born out of time_.” (John took that line from Sergio Leone’s ‘_Once Upon A Time In the West_.’) That line could easily apply to Rosalie Cunningham, and I mean that as the highest possible compliment!

Rosalie’s previous band, Purson, were superb. ‘Spiderweb Farm’ is one my all-time favourite songs (conjuring up images of a Denis Wheatley-esque 1960s to me). So, I never had any doubt that Rosalie’s debut solo album would be excellent, but it has more than exceeded my expectations.

Purson fans won’t be disappointed; yet this is something more again, a multi-talented, courageous and sincere artist, tapping into some internal well of inspiration, like Alice plunging down the rabbit hole.

As far as being ‘born out of time’ goes; all good art is timeless (all bad art is time specific). Recently I was listening to Black Sabbath’s ‘Sabotage’, The Beatles’ ‘Yellow Submarine’ and Jethro Tull’s ‘Aqualung’. And they could have been recorded yesterday, or tomorrow, they are that good. Rosalie Cunningham belongs in such company… she is the Once And Future Queen!
