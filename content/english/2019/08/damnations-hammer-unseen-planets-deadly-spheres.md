It’s a rare thing in this day and age to hear a band with such a strong identity and musical senses, and with such a perfect name. Damnation’s Hammer build on the foundations of great bands like Voivod, Sabbat, Celtic Frost, Venom, Death and Bathory to forge a sound that is uniquely their own. Their musicianship and songwriting are both first class. Here the riff is king, Huge Quorthon/Iommi/Warrior mutations that could shift the Earth off its axis. Moreover, there is a sense of dynamics, of pace, of craft, that is truly splendid.

In a just world, Damnation’s Hammer would be as big as Metallica, but even in an unjust world they have the potential to become the band Metallica could have become had Cliff Burton lived. Yes, Damnation’s Hammer are that heavy, that progressive, that special!

All hail!

(Massacre Records)
