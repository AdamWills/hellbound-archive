## Lethal Potion / Sovereign Remedy / Elixir Live, 3CD Remastered Boxset Edition

Listening to the recent ‘_Winds of Time_’ New Wave of British Heavy Metal collection it strikes me just how many fabulous bands the NWOBHM featured. Obviously, people are familiar with the likes of Venom, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Diamond Head, Angel Witch and Saxon, but there are so many more bands worthy of attention. One such band is **Elixir**.

Elixir came to the NWOBHM party somewhat late in the day, forming in 1983, and releasing their debut album ‘_The Son of Odin_’ in 1986. Elixir’s timing was off. With the exception of well-established hard-hitters like Iron Maiden, the NWOBHM was largely over at this time, and on one hand thrash metal (which was greatly inspired by the NWOBHM) was ascendant and on the other, a plague of lousy hair metal bands infested the world (punk icon Jordan memorably called them gonks – GONK METAL, there’s a new term for you!) Ironically, Elixir would find a much larger and more appreciative audience now.

This fine box set features Elixir’s second album ‘_Sovereign Remedy_’, which although it featured former Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr, wasn’t actually released until 1990 with a new title and different mix and tack listing, making up the second disc of this box set. Both versions have their merits, the original is best in my opinion but both have their merits.

Finally, the third disc, the self-explanatory ‘_Elixir Live_’ is worth purchasing the box set for in and of itself. Superb songs, great performances… true Sons of Odin indeed!
