It’s sad how mediocre so many graphic novels are when it’s a great storytelling medium. This, however, is not the case with the excellent ‘_Katusha_’, which tells the story of a young Ukrainian woman in the Great Patriotic War.

Often a historical story suffers from either being overwhelmed by the author’s research or else the research is poor and the fictional aspects overwhelm the story. Thankfully that hasn’t happened here: with the real and fictional aspects of the story combining flawlessly, you learn a lot but it just happens organically, and you really care about the characters. I love Wayne Vansant’s artwork as much as his text – it’s really original and sincere, a million miles away from plastic cookie cutter ‘super hero’ art.

Indeed, ‘_Katusha_’ reminds me a lot of Pat Mills and Joe Colquhoun’s ‘_Charley’s War_’ in its moving qualities and accurate research, but also the fact that both stories unfold from the point of view of a teenage protagonist.

An extremely moving tale, one that would appeal to anyone who likes a good story.
