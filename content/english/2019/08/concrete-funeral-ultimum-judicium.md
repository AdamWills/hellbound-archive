Concrete Funeral are excellent musicians but I would say what really makes ‘_Ultimum Judicium_’ work is the chemistry between the band members – they are very Bro-Festional! Perhaps uncommon in the genre they operate in, Death/Thrash, they have a good sense of humour. Overall, well played and well written; Concrete Funeral would appeal to fans of such bands as Carcass.
