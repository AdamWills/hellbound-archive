A new album from Darkthrone is always a special occasion. Recently I was watching Behemoth at King John’s Castle in Limerick when a friend enthused about ‘_Old Star_’: the look in her eyes of happiness said more than any words can about the quality of this album.

Indeed, ‘_Old Star_’ is up there, to me, with ‘_The Cult Is Alive_’ and ‘_The Underground Resistance_’; yes, it is that good! ‘The Hardship of the Scots’ features one of the best metal riffs ever, while the title track is an instant classic.

The cover artwork is amazing too, I have already purchased a t-shirt of it.

What makes ‘_Old Star_’, and all Darkthrone albums, special, is its sincerity. Like Motorhead and Iron Maiden, Darkthrone are a people’s band: they love their metal, which is how it should be!
