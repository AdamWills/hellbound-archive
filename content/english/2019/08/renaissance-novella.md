## 3 CD Remastered and Expanded Edition

Born out of the ashes of The Yardbirds (a band that proved fertile ground for creative people, look at Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page for instance), Renaissance made the kind of wonderful progressive rock that flourished in the 1970s. Their sound really is beautiful.

And this is very much in evidence on ‘_Novella_’. The original album is superb, benefitting from a fine remastering, and bonus material consisting of an entire concert at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is a true gem.

Cherry Red have lived up to their own high standards with this release and anyone who loves progressive rock played with passion and sincerity will find much to love here.
