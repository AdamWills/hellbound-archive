## Published by Dead Reckoning

Riff Reb’s is a truly remarkable storyteller; his artwork is timeless and evocative and his skills at writing easily match it.

As a man who has always loved the sea, I have always been aware of the element of the unknown it embodies. It looks beautiful but it can be dangerous, and this fine graphic novel captures this perfectly. Riff has adapted classic stories from Edgar Allan Poe, Jack London, Robert Louis Stevenson, Jules Verne and more, in the most perfect and unique fashion.

My favourite is the sad ‘The Sea Horses’ by William Hope Hodgson (Hodgson’s masterpiece, and an influence on H.P. Lovecraft, ‘The House On The Borderland’, was inspired by The Burren, not far from where I type this), it stays with you long after you’ve read it.

Strange and beautiful in equal measure, this is a fine example of what can be done with the medium of the graphic novel.
