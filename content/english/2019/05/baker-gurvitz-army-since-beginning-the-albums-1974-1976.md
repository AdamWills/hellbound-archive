Once again Esoteric must be applauded for releasing a superb box-set that is not just a pleasure to listen to but also historically important.

The Baker Gurvitz Army was formed in 1974 by former Gun and Three Man Army members Paul Gurvitz on bass/vocal, Adam Gurvitz on guitar/vocal, and Cram legend Ginger Baker on drums… of course.

This collection comprises three re-mastered albums: their self-titled debut, the superb ‘Elysian Encounter’, and their 1976 swan song ‘Hearts On Fire’.

This a very impressive body of work for a well-regarded live act that managed to release a great album for every year of its existence. I can’t see many bands doing that now. Also, it shows the value of a band’s recorded output, and its importance, because it will far outlive the band.

The musicianship is first rate as you’d expect, and the music is splendid with elements of hard rock, jazz, blues and even prog.

An important part of the history of 70s rock.
