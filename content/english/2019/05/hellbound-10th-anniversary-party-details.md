Hey everybody! We are having a party! Sat, June 1st is officially our 10th anniversary from the very first day that Hellbound.ca came to life. So, to celebrate we are going to have a party. Here's the official press release, the show is $10 and is happening here in Hamilton, Ontario at This Ain't Hollywood, 345 James Street North.

For immediate release

**HELLBOUND.CA ANNOUNCES TENTH ANNIVERSARY PARTY** **June 1st at This Ain’t Hollywood, Hamilton ON**

Award winning Hamilton based metal webzine Hellbound.ca celebrates its tenth anniversary with a special birthday party featuring five of the best local metal bands from the greater Hamilton area.

Launched on June 1st, 2009, Hellbound.ca was initially created as a spinoff of the Hellbound Radio program which aired weekly on Hamilton’s INDI 101, hosted by Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko, along with Matt Lewis. Both Kevin and Sean had been contributing writers to numerous publications, including Metal Maniacs and Unrestrained! Magazine. When both magazines suddenly closed up shop in early 2009, Sean started Hellbound.ca as a Canadian-based online portal into the underground metal scene. Still going strong ten years later, we will be hosting a show at Hamilton’s This Ain’t Hollywood nightclub, located at 345 James Street North in Hamilton on June 1st.

“It’s amazing to think that Hellbound.ca has been around for ten years,” says Sean Palmerston. “We have had the chance to interview and cover many of the biggest bands in metal, including legends like Judas Priest and Black Sabbath, amongst others. Hellbound.ca has also been fortunate enough to have some very special content exclusive to the site like the Heavy Metal Parenting and Blasphemous Meals cooking series, as well as our signature Top Canadian Metal Albums of the Year feature every January.”
