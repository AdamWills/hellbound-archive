## Materialities and Memories of War

Now, this is a book about World War One which truly deserves a wide audience, dealing as it does with an aspect of the Great War not as well-known as it should be. Basically, "Trench Art" refers to art created from the waste of war: crucifixes made of bullets, engraved shell cases, models of tanks and planes, jewellery, embroidery, and more. The array of art created from a combination of terror and boredom is astonishing. Nicholas writes knowledgeably and movingly on his subjects, and the photos and layout are first class as you would expect from Pen & Sword.
