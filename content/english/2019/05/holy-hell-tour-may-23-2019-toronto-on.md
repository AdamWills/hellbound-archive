The heavy-hitting lineup of the **Holy Hell Tour** brought hardcore legends **While She Sleeps, Thy Art is Murder**, and headliners **Architects** to Toronto, ON for back-to-back dates. The sold-out show captivated the audience from the beginning to the very end.

**While She Sleeps** opened the show with a bang that spread an intense energy throughout the **Danforth Music Hall**. Whether it was the first time hearing the band or a fan for years – they had the crowd moving for the entire set.

**Thy Art Is Murder** had announced that vocalist Chris “CJ” McMahon would be returning to Australia for the birth of his son, so Nick Arthur of Moltov Solution made his triumphant return to the stage to take his place. Fans were not disappointed when Nick was able to flawlessly perform the title track of the soon-to-be released album, _Human Target_. In true Thy Art Is Murder fashion, they kept the set as dark and heavy as imaginable.

Finally, **Architects** put on an emotionally charged performance of “Doomsday” to commemorate their original lead guitarist, Tom Searle, who had written part of the song before his passing in 2016. Setting a new dynamic for live performances with their mesmerizing stage presence, they are a force to be reckoned with in the metalcore genre.
