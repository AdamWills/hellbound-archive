After wrapping up their stint as part of the 2019 Decibel Tour in March, **Necrot** have not been just sitting around. The band has already announced more shows for this summer, including two exclusive Canadian dates (in Calgary and Winnipeg). And at the end of April they joined Aseptic in opening for Exhumed at Eli's in Oakland, California. While they were there, Hellbound's Todd Owens snagged some time to chat with members of Necrot.
