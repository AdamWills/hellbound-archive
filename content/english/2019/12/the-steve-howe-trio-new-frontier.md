Steve Howe is a living legend; his work with Yes alone is a sonic testimony to this.

And thus, with The Steve Howe Trio he has nothing to prove and is making music for all the right reasons, particularly the sheer enjoyment of it.

Featuring his son Dylan on drums, and Ross Stanley on organ, The Steve Howe Trio have a close family vibe in their playing on ‘New Frontier’.

I love the jazz/fusion sound of this album, it’s a real joy to listen too. Yes fans will particularly love the three compositions co-written with Bill Bruford.

Music made with love and it shows!
