Spirit’s blend of psychedelic and progressive rock is inspiring.

_Two Sides Of A Rainbow_ was originally recorded at the legendary Rainbow Theatre in London in 1978 and over the years has appeared in a variety of forms. This, I am very happy to say, is the definitive one. The sound is superb and organic and Randy and Spirit are heard to the best effect possible. The songs are classics and played with heart and skill.

This release features the entire concert along with some excellent bonus tracks. The re-mastering is superb and finally I have to mention the photos and an excellent essay from Mick Skidmore.

Essential for Spirit fans.
