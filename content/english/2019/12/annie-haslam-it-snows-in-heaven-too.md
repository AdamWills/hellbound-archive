Originally released in 2000 on Annie’s own White Dove Label, this fine Christmas album has been out of print for many a year so its re-mastered  reissue is most welcome; especially at this time of year!

Annie is of course famous for her work with Renaissance; and gives her own unique voice to this fine collection of Christmas songs.

What I like most about this collection is that it evokes childhood memories of Christmas rather than the over-commercialised Christmas the media bombards is with. Which is a special thing and more in tune with the spirit of Christmas.

Recommended for those who like Christmas for the right reasons.
