In 2019 we see that music has become to many almost like fast food, consumed quickly without any lasting effects. Cherry Red Records is not like this. It sees an artist’s work for what it is: something of long-lasting value to be treated with the reverence it deserves. The hardback packaging of this CD set is superb.

‘All Is Dream’ is a very worthy follow-up to ‘Deserters’ Song’ and continues in the same lush experimental vein. ‘The Dark Is Rising’ opens ‘All In Dream’ in fine style, a statement of intent for the songs that follow.

In an already impressive body of work, ‘All Is Dream’ is truly outstanding. The second disc of demos, B-Sides and outtakes is essential. I love things like this, they are really special, lovely cover songs too. The two remaining discs are excellent live recordings.

A beautiful album given the beautiful treatment it deserves.
