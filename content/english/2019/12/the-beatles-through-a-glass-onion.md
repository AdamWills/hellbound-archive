## ‘Reconsidering The White Album’

### Edited by Mark Osteen

#### Published by University of Michigan Press

The _White Album_, one of the most influential albums of all time, gets the book it so richly deserves in this fine collection of essays.

Highlights include Steve Hamelman’s essay on the criminally-underrated Ringo Starr and Kenneth Womack’s excellent piece on George Martin’s work both with and outside of  The Beatles. Mention must also be made of Russell Reisling’s terrific ‘The Beatles and the Fruits of Psychedelia’.

A most worthy companion to a most worthy album.
