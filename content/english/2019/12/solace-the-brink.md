Those who don’t follow the circuit of U.S. underground stoner/doom festivals might have been wondering what happened to **Solace**. After all, it has been nearly 10 years since their last album, which just one very limited cassette single in between. But they’ve been fairly active on the live front, [tearing it up at Maryland Doom Fest](https://hellbound.ca/2019/06/maryland-doom-fest-2019-photos-thursday-june-20/) this past summer, where they previewed a few tunes from their long-awaited fourth album, _The Brink_.

This 11-track, 67-minute effort gets underway with “Breaker of the Way,” an eight-minute, organ-heavy, 70s-style heavy rock jam, which speeds up to a “Highway Star” chug around the 3:30 mark, complete with a ripping guitar solo that would probably make Ritchie Blackmore proud…if he ever took delight in the playing of others.

“Desert Coffin” takes a more heavy-metal approach, with a swirling opening riff that reminds me of Argus. This one settles into a steady chug, with the dual-guitar attack adding some epic doom flourishes a la Candlemass, with a similarly epic impact on the chorus. “Dead Sailor’s Dream” slows things down for a mellower, desert-rock number that reminds me of local stoners Low Orbit…until it hits you with a 100-word-a-minute, rapid-fire pre-chorus that has shades of Clutch. Did not see that coming!

“The Light is a Lie” opens with one of the most headbangable doom-metal riffs you’ll hear this year, shifting into a slightly more than mid-paced tempo a la Blood of the Sun before bringing back the heavy riff again for a sickly sweet chorus. Meanwhile, the nine-and-a-half-minute title track is an epic voyage in doomy space rock, a swinging sea shanty with no shortage of heavy grooves.

It’s almost a shame that the organ, which features so prominently on tunes like “Crushing Black” and “The Brink” isn’t a part of their live lineup – although these songs still sound great in any configuration.
