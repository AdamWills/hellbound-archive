### Matt Hinch

**Listening to:** I've been spending most of my time lately listening to music I listened to in high school that came out at that time. 1992-1997. I went on a really nice Alice in Chains run yesterday.

**New release:** It came out in October I think but _Pollinator_ by Cloud Rat is really the only new release I've listened to in the past two weeks. Wicked grind! I'll make time for Cattle Decapitation though.

**Live:** I listened to Alice in Chains - _Unplugged_ twice. That should count.

**Non-Metal:** A lot of that '92-'97 music was not metal but I'll go with Florence + the Machine - _High As Hope_

**Wild card:** THE MANDOLORIAN!!!!!

### Sarah Riley

**Listening to:** Suffocation - _Entrails of You_ (Suffocation, Relapse Records, 2006). Forever will be the best love song ever written and the only one I want to hear.

**New release:** Well, the new release I've been anticipating and impatiently waiting for is unsurprisingly Cattle Deceptions new record _Death Atlas_ (Metal Blade Records, November 29th, 2019). To say the very least, it was exactly what I expected. The previous album released by Cattle Decap (_The Anthropocene Extinction_, Metal Blade Records, 2015) I can easily say is in my mental list of top 10 all time favorite albums. With that being said, a very high bar had been set for this latest release. Throughout _The Anthropocene Extinction_, Travis Ryan would tease these fairly minute and further between peculiar sounding clean vocals; my circle of friends have taken to referring to this vocal maneuver as the "Sméagol" vocals. The "Sméagol" vocals received a crazy amount of positive feedback from their fanbase, myself included. They were unique and sound super distinct in a sort of melodic way. So, I'd find myself always eagerly waiting for the break of irregularity within the album. _Death Atlas_ has become the album where Cattle Decapitation has really decided to embrace those vocals. And why wouldn't they? Like I said, it was receiving such good feed back. Where I now have a little bit of a dilemma with this is, my enjoyment of the "Sméagol" vocals stemmed from the build up and progression, as well as how they were dispersed further apart. Now that almost every song on this new record consists of this vocal pattern and it isn't placed in short powerful segments, I'm not enjoying it as much as I did prior to this release. Does that mean I don't think the record is sick? Not at all, its a solid piece and I still have an undying love for Cattle Decapitation, I probably always will. I have no doubt this album will go great lengths for them and be extremely successful. However, the heavier Decap just holds a little more space in my heart.

**Live:** Arrival Of Autumn, Red and In Flames @ The Phoenix Concert Theatre, Toronto, November 27th. Wildly nostalgic seeing In Flames play _Only for the Weak_ live.

**Non-metal:** The Hillbilly Moon Explosion - _Northern Crown._ I really don't know what's been up with me and these rockabilly/cowpunk/rebel country groups lately. Wack.

**Wild card:** The DFA Nacho's from Sneaky Dee's, Toronto, are pretty damn tight.

### Laura Wiebe

**Listening to:** Opeth - _In Cauda Venenum_ (Swedish Version)

**New release:** Avatarium - _The Fire I Long For_ and the Völur/Amber Asylum split - _Breaker of Rings / Blood Witch_

**Non-metal:** my own mental mashup of "Dynamite" by Taio Cruz and the Pet Shop Boys' version of "You're Always on My Mind"

**Wild card:** _Murder, She Wrote_ reruns

### Adam Wills

**Listening to:** Alcest - _Spiritual Instinct_

**New release:** Cattle Decapitation - _Death Atlas_

**Non-metal:** Mike Patton & Jean-Claude Vannier - _Corpse Flower_

**Wild card:** _Parasite_, directed by Bong Joon-ho
