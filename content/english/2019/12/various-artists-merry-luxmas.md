## It’s Christmas In Crampsville!

Once again The Cramps have scoured their vinyl basement to unearth, in this case, pleasingly alternative Christmas songs.

How can you argue with a song (from the splendidly named Gayla Peevey) called ‘I Want A Hippopotamus For Christmas’. Rock ‘n’ roll!

Put simply, this is a great Christmas compilation; even people who don’t like Christmas will like it!

Ho, ho, ho, indeed!

(Cherry Red Records)
