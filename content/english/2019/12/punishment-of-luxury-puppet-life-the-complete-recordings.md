Punishment of Luxury are a band that have much in common with The Fall, in the sense of being hugely influential and also in the sense that are not at all as well known as they deserve.

This fine boxset goes a long way to right this wrong!

Punishment of Luxury had a creative background in English theatre groups. From the off, they were unique and could share a stage with anyone from The Cure to Motorhead.

Songs like ‘Puppet Life’ are truly original; and would appeal to anyone who likes bands like Killing Joke, Public Image Limited and Talking Heads.

From such joys as their superb debut album ‘Laughing Academy’ (worth purchasing the boxset just for this) to things like their 1981 mail-order cassette ‘Ggantic Days’; this is one of the most eclectic and exciting collections you couyld ever hope to hear.
