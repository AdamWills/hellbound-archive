The Complete Transatlantic Recordings 1969-1971

Fair dues to Quentin Tarantino, his use of Steelers Wheel’s ‘Stuck in The Middle with You’ in ‘Reservoir Dogs’ brought Gerry Rafferty back in the public eye (Quentin having a very good ear for a tune) but there is much more to Gerry Rafferty to than just that tune (and the immortal ‘Baker Street’).

This superb collection proves that, the first disc ‘The Humblebums’ features Gerry’s work with the great Billy Connolly, I absolutely love this, I grew up hearing tunes like ‘Her Father Didn’t Like Me Anyway’, and the chemistry between the two musicians is wonderful. It also shows the strong Irish and Scottish connections which persist to this day, some lovely bonus tracks too.

Disc Two is a fine version of Gerry’s ‘Can I Have My Money Back’ solo album and it is amazing, what a talent the man was. Many lovely bonus tracks here.

Bottom line, if you love musicianship, song-writing and above all, passion for music (this is from the heart, Gerry lived his music); this is utterly essential.
