![27: The Legend and Mythology of the 27 Club by Gene Simmons](https://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gene-Simmons-27-Club.jpg)

Most people reading this review will have heard of the legend of the 27 Club, basically a group of talented musicians all having in common the fact that they died aged 27.

The myth began in the 60s with the death of Brian Jones. Over the years membership of the club increased with the likes of Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and more.

I am very impressed with this book; it is well-written, as you’d expect from an erudite intelligent man. It also has insights into the life of a successful musician that only another successful musician could have.

But what really surprises me is the degree of humanity with which Gene writes about his subjects — this impresses me most of all.

A great addition to anyone’s collection of music books.
