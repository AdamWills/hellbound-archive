As the new year rolls in, we ask you to join us once again for an update on what the people of Hellbound have been digging these days.

 

## Hellbound Recommends

### Steve Earles

**New Release:** Sigh - _Heir To Despair_. Managing to be both traditional metal and totally 'out there' at the same time. Well worth listening to.

**Live:** Not in impoverished January. Sigh!

**Non Metal:** The Smiths - _The Queen Is Dead._ Just beautiful. No more to say!

**Wild Card:** David McCraney - _You Are Not So Smart_. A book that will change the way you look at the world. Well worth a careful read.

### Arta Gailuma

**Listening to:** SAOR. Can't wait to hear the full album _Forgotten Paths_, out in February.

**New release:** From this month's newness I did like Carnal Forge, _Gun To Mouth Salvation_, released via The Orchard Music on January 25th, 2019.

**Live:** Powerwolf with supports Amaranthe and Kissin' Dynamite. For some time I have not been to a gig where supports were as good as the main act.

### Gruesome Greg

**Listening to:** Weedeater - _Jason the Dragon_

**New release:** WOORMS - _Slake_

**Live:** Just saw Freedom Hawk live for the first time after listening to 'em for 10 years. They killed it!

**Non-metal:** Greta Van... nah, just kidding. Merle Haggard - _I Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink._

**Wild Card:** Tim Hortons' new chicken strips? Not worth it…

### Matt Hinch

**Listening to:** I'm riding another Brant Bjork wave. I love that dude. Heavy Psych Sounds will be reissuing 2003 stoner classic _Keep Your Cool_. I'm keeping my cool by listening to it! [https://brantbjork.bandcamp.com/album/keep-your-cool](https://brantbjork.bandcamp.com/album/keep-your-cool)

**New release:** Keeping that vibe is _John Garcia & The Band of Gold_, the newest from the legendary John Garcia. His vocal performance on this one is just outstanding. The tunes are pretty groovy too. [https://johngarcia.bandcamp.com/album/john-garcia-and-the-band-of-gold](https://johngarcia.bandcamp.com/album/john-garcia-and-the-band-of-gold)

**Live:** I took my 14-year-old daughter to Laval to see Panic! At the Disco a couple weeks ago. She called me an asshole for not getting up and dancing. I let it slide. The cover of "Bohemian Rhapsody" gave me a reason to headbang for a few seconds at least.

**Non-metal:** Are Brant Bjork and John Garcia metal? What about Fu Manchu?

**Wild Card:** I still haven't fleshed out my top 40 of 2018 but I have been listening to some of them. This gives me an opportunity to pump Sunnata yet another time.
