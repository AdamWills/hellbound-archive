Once again Cherry Red have excelled in presenting an important and influential band’s work in the best possible light. A huge influence on Cliff Burton-era Metallica, G.B.H are a special band indeed.

This box set, which has 76 tracks over 5 discs, covers GBH’s output for the Rough Justice label between 1984 and 1985. Disc one is 1984’s _Midnight Madness And Beyond_ along with the EP _Oh No. It’s GBH Again_ as a welcome bonus. Disc two is 1987’s _No Need To Panic_ album with the addition of the _Wot A Bargain_ EP. Disc three is the splendidly named _A Fridge Too Far_ with rare demos as a bonus. Disc Four is 1990’s _From Here To Reality_, again with added demos. The box set concludes with disc five, 1992’s _Church of the Truly Warped_.

The photos and liner notes are excellent. This is a well-deserved representation of an excellent band.
