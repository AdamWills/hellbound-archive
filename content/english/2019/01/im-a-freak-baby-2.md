## A Further Journey Through The British Heavy Psych and Hard Rock Underground Scene 1968-73

I didn’t hear the first volume of this series which is a shame as it is brilliant; it’s like a proto-metal box set for ‘_Life On Mars_’. It is a veritable musical time machine, aural archaeology spread over three splendid discs.

The forty page booklet is a thing of beauty and joy in itself. It would make a great book of expanded content. (Cherry Red take note, there is a fine idea for you!)

If I were to go through every single track on this box set, this would be a far too long review, so I’ll concentrate on a few personal favourites to give you a taste of it.

‘Guts’ by Welsh proto-metallers **Budgie** is an important track. Budgie are an important band. Metallica covered ‘Crash Course In Brain Surgery’ and ‘Breadfan’ with good reason (and should do more – I can see them making a decent job of ‘I Turned To Stone’ off ‘_Nightflight_’). I have to add that a box set on CD and vinyl of Budgie's albums would be a splendid idea for Cherry Red.

Also featured is ‘Horse’ by **Sam Gopal**, which featured a certain Lemmy Kilmister in the line-up, and where would be world of music be without him, I shudder to ask?

There is an awesome demo of ‘Fire’ by **The Crazy World of Arthur Brown**.

Other gems include ‘Bullet’ by the splendidly named **Sinister Minister**, ‘Shapes of Things’ by **Jeff Beck**, ‘Freelance Fiend’ by **Leaf Hound** and much more besides!

I can’t recommend this box set enough, and so many of these bands deserve to have their full-lengths released on CD and vinyl. Again, Cherry Red take note!
