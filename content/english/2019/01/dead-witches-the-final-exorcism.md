If you ever wanted to hear what Electric Wizard might sound like with female vocals, this is the band for year. Featuring venerable ex-Wizard can-basher Mark Greening, **Dead Witches** recorded their sophomore effort in the same rural English studio as _Dopethrone_ and _Let Us Prey_…although I’d say this one sounds more akin to the Wizard of 10-12 years ago, i.e. _Witchcult Today_ or _Black Masses_.

After a 30-second horror-movie intro, the title track gets things properly underway with a classic Electric Wizard riff and vocals that certainly channel Jus Oborn, but with a bit more upper register. “Goddess of the Night” contains plenty of wah and fuzz-pedal effects, with a soaring vocal and crunchy stop-start riffs making this a piece of prototypical stoner doom, complete with an eerie organ outro. We get a jangly, gothic 98-second interlude in “When Do the Dead See the Sun” before “The Church by the Sea” offers up another solid stoner-doom riff with the airy, anguished vocals one would come to expect from the Wizard…or the Witches, for that matter.
