I’ve only recently gotten into **Tangerine Dream** via their excellent soundtrack for the ‘_Wages of Fear_’ remake ‘_Sorcerer_’. So I really enjoyed reviewing this boxset.

‘_The Blue Years_’ is a value-for-money four-CD set comprising four albums released by Tangerine Dream between 1985 and 1987, a prolific period.

The first, ‘_Le Parc_’, is excellent and includes a reworked version of the band’s theme to the TV series _Streethawk_, 80s bliss!

Most interesting is the second disc, ‘_Green Desert_’ which began as a session in Berlin in 1973! Additional work was done in 1984, with the album finally released in 1986. A truly fascinating evolution of the band’s music.

The third disc, ‘_Underwater Sunlight_’, is a highly influential ambient classic. You can hear its influence in much of the ambient music that came in its wake.

Finally the fourth disc, ‘_Tyger_’, is inspired by the poetry of William Blake, and is a most uplifting experience.

For new and old fans of Tangerine Dream, this is indeed an excellent value-for-money boxset.
