One band that's no stranger to touring Toronto is Corrosion of Conformity. By my count, I've seen em at The Opera House four times in the last six years--and I didn't even bother going to the make-up date with Zakk Wylde. Another thing that can be said for COC is that they usually bring some solid supporting acts on the road with em. I know it's only February, but this might be the best bill, from top to bottom, I'll see all year (festivals not included).

Just like COC's [2015 tour](https://hellbound.ca/2015/12/amateur-concert-photography-hour-coc-brant-bjork-saviours-mothership/), this outing saw [Texas trio Mothership](http://mothershipusa.com/) kick things off with a brisk, rockin' 25-minutes. Their self-titled album from 2013 remains a personal fav, and they bookended this four-song set with two tracks from said record -- "Lunar Master" and "Angel of Death." (No, not the Slayer number!) Not gonna lie, one of the main reasons I bought tickets for Maryland Doom Fest was to catch a full headlining set from these guys. I've seen 'em bring it live for 30 minutes on a few occasions, so I'm definitely looking forward to watching 'em for 60+!

Before the gig, all the talk was around whether Wino would be deemed admissible to Canada, a fact he alluded to when introducing "To Protect and Serve." Their 40-minute set was heavy on _The Church Within_, just like when I saw 'em in Pittsburgh last year. Hey, it's not like the other guys in the band played on any of the old records, but a good solid dose of Wino--especially on this side of the line--is always well worth watching.

We were joking before their set that the first rule of Crowbar is No Long Pants in Crowbar. And sure enough, despite the (slightly) sub-zero temperatures outside, the NOLA sludge veterans took the stage--all in shorts--to the strains of "All I Had I Gave." They didn't seem to have a proper setlist, but busted out a buncha tunes from across their back catalogue, with "Walk With Knowledge Wisely" from 2014's _Symmetry in Black_ being an unexpected highlight. Come to think of it, the last time I saw Crowbar live mighta been in 2014...

Corrosion of Conformity put out a new album since the last time I saw em...but you wouldn't know it from this setlist, which featured only one new song ("Wolf Named Crow"). Instead, they stuck with a lot of the usual suspects from _Deliverance_, _Wiseblood_, "Vote with a Bullet" and a few tunes from _America's Volume Dealer_, which still doesn't sound too bad. No "Drowning in a Daydream," but they did an extended version of "Clean My Wounds" as an encore that even had a bass solo!!!
