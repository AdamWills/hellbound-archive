First heard about this Southern Ontario supergroup (of sorts) back in ’07, when they released their first, self-titled **Supermansion** album. They put out a second record five years later, unbeknownst to me, and now they’ve got five albums under their belt, with _Solar Order_ being the latest, independent release. Not sure if this one is quite the collaborative effort of the debut, which featured about a dozen different local musicians, but it looks like the brains of the operation is still the same guy who once played in a funky, Clutch-worshipping Windsor outfit called The Jet Trio… so you can bet your bottom dollar there will be riffs.

_Solar Order_ starts off with an opening theme, “Theme from Solar Order,” 90 seconds of organ-driven retro rock a la Deep Purple. The riffs kick in with “White Sun (Dead Man Rhythm)” and the Clutch is very strong with this one, a groovy, driving back-beat with two-man tradeoff vocals. After a spoken-word intro, “Hole in the Universe” hits like a grungy Soundgarden ripper that’ll get a decent head-nod going. “Heartbreaker” is another heavy riffer, albeit with an eerie piano section that kicks in around the three-minute mark, whereas the lighter, janglier “Secret Spider” reminds me more of Weezer.

Further shades of Clutch abound on the speedy, two-and-a-half-minute “Manvil,” the slinky, slithering “Head and a Tail” before the synthy, seven-minute title track brings things to a close. For all the heavy riffs packed into this one, the proggy note they leave us on certainly stands out.
