## Various Artists - 3CD boxed set

1968 was a milestone year, both musically and socially (as evidenced by an excellent documentary series that recently aired on the History Channel). We very much live today in a world that is shaped by the events of 1968, such as the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King.

Musically, the releases of 1968 shaped the music of the coming decade and beyond. There is a pleasing variety of artists featured in this box set. From the obscure always to future megastars.

Disc One features such treasures as ‘Sunshine Help Me’ by Spooky Tooth, ‘One Eyed Hound’ by Genesis, ‘Fire’ by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, ‘And The Address’ by Deep Purple.

Disc Two highlights include ‘Black Magic Woman’ by Fleetwood Mac. ‘Pearly Queen’ by Traffic and ‘Shapes of Things’ by Jeff Beck.

Disc Three features the splendid likes of ‘My Sunday Feeling’ by Jethro Tull, ‘Cold Embrace’ by Sam Gopal and ‘Race With The Devil’ by Gun.

Most importantly, this fine collection illustrates how rock music would split into various genres such as hard rock, heavy metal, folk rock, and progressive rock.

Overall, ‘Revolution’ is a must have for anyone who loves rock music and want to learn more of its origins.
