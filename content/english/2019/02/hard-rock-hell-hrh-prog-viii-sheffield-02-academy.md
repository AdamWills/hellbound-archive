## Same weekend, same line-up as Shepherd's Bush Empire event

HRH Prog's 8th Cycle at the iconic Shepherd's Bush Empire sold out within 12 weeks. In response, HRH are now staging a second weekend at the HRH base at the 02 Academy in Sheffield. The dates and prices will be the same dates, and the exact same line up will play on opposite day: The Pineapple Thief, Gong, Uriah Heep, Caravan, Soft Machine, Hawklords, Krankschaft and many many more.

This additional weekend of HRH Prog 8 will run over the 26th and 27th of October 2019, from 13.00 to 23.00 each day.

There are two types of weekend passes – Royalty (private balcony, bar, lounge, toilets and seats) or Standard (stalls) – as well as hotel packages including Royalty or Standard tickets.

Packages are available now from [http://www.hrhprog.com/product-category/prog-8-2019-sheffield/](http://www.hrhprog.com/product-category/prog-8-2019-sheffield/)
