After Black Sabbath and Motorhead, I consider that **Venom** are the third most influential metal band; few bands have inspired and influenced three genres of metal, black metal, death metal and thrash metal. The first two Venom albums, ‘_Welcome To Hell_’ and ‘_Black Metal_’ are essential for any metal fans collection.

Now, many years later, we find two versions of Venom. The Mantas led Venom Inc seems to have gathered a lot of ‘true spirit of Venom’ style reviews, which I would agree with, but I’d also say that ‘_Storm The Gates_’ is very much an excellent Venom album. Of course, the playing is much better than on the 80s album but that is to be expected – musicians progress.

This is a powerful well-played, well-produced metal album, that would put many more lauded bands to shame.
