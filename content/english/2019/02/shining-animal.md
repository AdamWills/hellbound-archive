The dilemma most bands face is whether to progress or not. AC/DC have made a very successful career out of sticking to the same formula; so too have Slayer. Conversely, bands like Rush, Voivod and Mastodon have followed the path of constant change and innovation, and done well as a result.

Shining have chosen, on ‘_Animal_’, a radically different path from the ‘black jazz’ of previous releases. Some ‘black jazz’ fans will not like this change, but for the fair-minded listeners, there is much to like here, not least the fact that is a very strong set of songs.

Shining will lose some fans, but gain more. They are in it for the long haul.
