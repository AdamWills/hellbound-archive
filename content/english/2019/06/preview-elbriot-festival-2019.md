## Swedes In Flames headlining the seventh edition of Elbriot

The 7th edition of the Elbriot Festival will take place right in the heart of German city Hamburg, at the Grossmarkt on Saturday, 17 August 2019.

Elbriot festival's headliners this year will be heavy metallers **In Flames**. The Swedes released their latest album _I, the Mask_ on 1 March this year and Elbriot will be the last stop on their long summer festival list.

With more confirmations on the way, we also will have the chance to see the energetic Australian quartet **Airbourne**, American metalcore band **Hatebreed**, Californian's **Of Mice & Men**, theatrical Swedish heavy metal act **Avatar**, British power metal band **DragonForce**, Swiss avantgarde metal six- piece **Zeal & Ardor** and Ukrainian metallers **Jinjer**.

That promises to be a wonderful festival day!

In 2018 the organisers of Elbriot Festival come up with a new festival – **Hammaburg Fest**, which took place a day before Elbriot at the same location with focus on medieval rock and metal.

Hammaburg Fest's debut in the festival world started with four German bands: medieval metal band In Extremo, heavy metal five-piece Die Apokalyptischen Reiter, medieval folk rockers Schandmaul and Feuerschwanz.

After a successful first year, the second edition of Hammaburg Fest will be taking place on Friday, August 16th at the same location as Elbriot – Grossmarkt im Hamburg. This year the festival is planning to lead us down the memory lane and focus on the 1980s and '90s. So far we have two confirmations: British rockers **Sisters of Mercy** and Swedish rap metal band **Clawfinger**.
