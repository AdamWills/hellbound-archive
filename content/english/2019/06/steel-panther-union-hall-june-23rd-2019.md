What a fucking ridiculous show: Steel Panther has got to be one of the most ridiculous bands I’ve ever seen and I mean that in the best way possible. At this show you got to see a little bit of everything heavy metal, titties and a bunch of guys with wigs and animal print leggings.

Starting off the night was Edmonton’s own **Striker**. I’ve seen these guys before but not for a few years. By the time Striker came on it was already a pretty full house at Union Hall. I think they were just the right band to be opening / touring with Steel Panther for the Sunset Strip Live tour. With the modern heavy metal sound and an 80’s feel to them Striker have made a pretty good name for themselves over the past couple of years. They have played across the globe and even opened for Metallica in 2012.

This was my third time seeing **Steel Panther** and every time I see them the shows just get better and better. While I was in the photo pit I just about teared up from laughing so hard at the jokes after jokes. With song names like "Asian Hooker," "Poontang Boomerang," and "Gloryhole" it’s really hard to take these guys seriously, and they're definitely going to offend some people. It’s kind of the beauty of them though – they are all great musicians but their song lyrics are just ridiculous. During the performance of "Asian Hooker" they invited a lovely Asian lady to come up on stage and dance with them, as well a little later in the night they had the whole stage full of lovely ladies dancing away.

With these guys it’s almost a guarantee that you’re going to see some boobs on stage but last night I think some people got a little more of a view than that when one of the ladies on stage pulled up her dress rather than pulling it down. From where I was standing on the upper level of the venue I can’t confirm exactly what was seen but either which way people got a show, music and otherwise. Both bands were a blast to photograph and watch. I would definitely check them both out if you haven’t already!
