## Hellbound recommends

### Steve Earles

**New Release:** Membranes - _What Nature Gives... Nature Takes Away._ **Live:** Asomvel At Dolans Limerick. A killer mix of Venom and Motorhead... which is as it should be but seldom is. **Non Metal:** Tangerine Dream - _The Official Bootleg Series Volume Three._

**Wild Card:** _The Many Lives of the Evil Dead_. An excellent collection of essays about the much loved series. And remember, Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi and Robert Tappert. No Ash... No Evil Dead.

### Arta Gailuma

**Listening to**: _Symphony X_. Excited to see them live soon for the first time [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uY6MNuMdUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uY6MNuMdUU)

**New release**: It has to be Rammstein long-awaited new album (released on May 17th) [https://www.rammstein.de/en/new-album/](https://www.rammstein.de/en/new-album/)

**Live**: For the first time finally got to see Dimmu Borgir live. Very impressive performance musically and visually.

### Gruesome Greg

**Listening to:** Saint Vitus - self-titled (1984)

**New release:** Saint Vitus - self titled (2019)

**Live:** Church of Misery with Mondo Generator, Toke, Against the Grain in Detroit

**Non-Metal:** Jon Pardi - _Heartache Medication_

**Wild card:** Just saw the best AC/DC tribute band at Rib Fest, the first of many summer food festivals in Toronto...

### Matt Hinch

**Listening to:** I recently went on a big Local H bender. I never realized how active they've been this century. But I still go back to _As Good As Dead_.

**New Release:** Call of the Void - _Buried in Light_ (Translation Loss, May 10, 2019): "loud metallic sludgepunk" sounds pretty accurate. This band's brand of rage is satisfyingly great. Heavy and not too crazy, it makes you feel alive on the way toward death.

**Non-metal:** A little girl I once knew named Kaiya is all grown up now and makes some pretty good "dreamfolk" music under the name Cade. Here's her newest track.

**Wild Card:** Speaking of wild and new track... the new Wizard Rifle track is a blessed kind of bonkers. I love these guys and can't wait for a new album! But I'll take a "Rocket to Hell" for now.

**Wild Card:** _Mid90s_. A film written and directed by Jonah Hill

### Laura Wiebe
