## 4CD Remastered Boxset

It speaks volumes for the quality and status of **Tangerine Dream**’s music that this is the third volume of their official bootleg series and the quality shows absolutely no signs of flagging.

Of course, with a history that goes back to 1967 there are going to be a lot of stellar performances in Tangerine Dream’s career. The first two discs feature a concert at the Ford Auditorium in Detroit in 1977, and the quality of the musicianship is superb. Discs three and four were recorded at The Regent Theatre in Sydney in 1982 and are my favourites of this boxset, featuring sublime performances.

Overall a must-have for fans of Tangerine Dream
