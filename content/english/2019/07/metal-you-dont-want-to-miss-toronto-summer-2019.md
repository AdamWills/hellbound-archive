Summertime madness is here and it's a hot one in Toronto.  As usual, despite all efforts to the contrary we are a city spoiled for choice in the realm of genre-defying, innovative and unusual sounds.  From mind-bending doom and experimental treats to highly danceable synthpop, there's no shortage of flavours being served up in July and August.

Your friendly neighbourhood fangirl (hello!) is pleased to share some of the highlights of the weird and wonderful, below.  Particularly of interest is Thursday August 15, when there is not one, but a plethora of picks to tickle the eardrums.   Choose your own adventure...
