## Celebrating Canuck Metal: 10 Years of Canada Day coverage from Hellbound

We at Hellbound love metal. And as a Canadian-based site, we have a particular soft spot for Canadian metal. Each July 1 on Canada Day (our national holiday), we put in a little extra effort to highlight some of our favourite Canadian metal. Here is a look back at 10 years of Canada Day Canadian metal features put together by us here at Hellbound.ca.
