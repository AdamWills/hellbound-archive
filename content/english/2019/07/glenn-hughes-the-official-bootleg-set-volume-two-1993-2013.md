## 6-CD Clamshell Boxset

I had the great pleasure of seeing Glenn Hughes at the Olympia in Dublin in 2018. Playing a set of classic **Deep Purple** material, it was one of the best gigs I’ve ever seen. The Voice of Rock lived up to his name! And, Glenn, if you read this, come back to play in Ireland soon.

As well as being a great musician, Glenn Hughes has the most warm and sincere manner you can imagine, which in an era when negativity is inexplicably celebrated, is an absolute joy to hear.

All six CDs are excellent, particularly disc one, _Incense and Peaches_, which features demos of a high standards. Elsewhere we find such classics as Trapeze’s ‘You Are The Music’ and ‘Coast To Coast’. Other joys include covers of ‘House of the Rising Sun’ and Ozzy’s ‘Goodbye To Romance’.

My favourite disc is disc six, recorded at the Crossroads Club in Rome in 2013 and featuring seven Deep Purple classics: ‘Stormbringer’, ‘Might Just Take Your life’, ‘Sail Away’, ‘Mistreated’, ‘Getting’ Tighter’, ‘You Keep On Moving’ ‘Burn’ and a cover of Stevie Wonder’s ‘Superstition’.

Glenn is a legend… but one very much living!
