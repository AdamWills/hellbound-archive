## 02.07.2019. Mama RouxÂ 

Even though Dutch horror metallers **Carach Angren** have gained huge popularity and loyal following in the latest years, in UK they have been rare guests.

Carach Angren's Birmingham date at the little venue Mama Roux was right in the middle of band's Pitch Black Summer European headline tour on which they were accompanied by Finnish melodic death metal quartet **Wolfheart**, Dallas based black metallers **Thy Antichrist** who were hitting European shores for the first time and American blackened death metal band **Nevalra**.

Carach Angren's set played in Birmingham consisted of both new and older pieces, including songs from band's debut release, 2008 concept album _Lammendamm_.

For those who don't know, Carach Angren do use a lot theatrics at their stage shows whilst their music is incorporating symphonic and orchestral elements and lyrical themes are dark and based on mysterious stories. It was no different in Mama Roux, the use of masks made by their own frontman Seregor, the creepy face paint and grimacing and certainly the stylized "killing" at the "Blood Queen" song may have sent shivers down the spine, but made the whole thing a brilliant experience.

Carach Angren did definitely make a statement on how amazing they are as a live act. Please, do come back soon to UK!
