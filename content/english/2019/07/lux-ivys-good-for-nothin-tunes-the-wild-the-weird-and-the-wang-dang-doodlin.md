## Various artists: a double CD featuring 50 classic slices of madcap vinyl as enthused over by The Cramps’ Lux and Ivy

You’d expect a compilation compiled by Lux Interior and Poison Ivy of The Cramps to be somewhat out there and it doesn’t disappoint. Although the tunes are weird, they are also very good, and it would cost an absolute fortune to hunt down the originals. Hours of great fun to be had here! My personal highlight has to be "I’d Rather Be Burned As A Witch" by the awesome Eartha Kitt!

Great to review a collection that really does live up to its splendid title!
