## A Lifetime In Music, 1957-2019 - 4CD Boxset

One of my great musical heroes was (and still is) Ian ‘Lemmy’ Kilmister, I remember reading an interview with Lemmy where he spoke of his love of rock ‘n’ roll growing up. Indeed, I remember seeing Motorhead on the ‘Inferno’ tour and Lemmy introduced his band with the immortal words: “We are Motorhead and we play rock ‘n’ roll”. Marty Wilde would have been one of the first generation of British rock ‘n’ rollers that Lemmy grew up on and was influenced by.

Amazingly Marry is 80 this year and still touring! Now that really is rock ‘n’ roll! Marty has had a six decades career as performer and writer and inded mentor to his daughter Kim; few artists can say that.

Discs one and two are composed of early As and Bs, lots of hits here, and one of the many joys of a Cherry Red – it would be ultra expensive and nigh on impossible to collect all this music yourself (to say nothing of the superior sound quality on the boxsets).

Disc three is a real gem, containing as it does a previously unreleased Radio Luxemborg performance dating from 1959. Finally disc four consists of previously unheard demos from Marty’s archive.

The remastered sound is excellent and the booklet notes comprehensive and engaging.

Overall, an important collection for an artist that did much to establish British rock ‘n’ roll, and one, pleasingly, that is still going strong today!
