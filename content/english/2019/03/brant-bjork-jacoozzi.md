It’s always a good day for stoner rock when Brant Bjork releases a new record—although this isn’t really a new, new record, and it isn’t your typical **Brant Bjork** record, either. Recorded in 2010, _Jacoozzi_ is just Brant jammin’ with himself, playing all the instruments like he did on _Jalamanta_, his solo debut from ’99…albeit with no vocals (until the last song) and a few more jazz/funk influences.

The 47-minute album kicks off with some funky, jazzy drumming on “Can’t Outrun the Sun,” as a bit of a warbling riff takes hold. This is about as mellow as desert rock gets – think Yawning Man more than Kyuss – although it meanders on a bit too long at a shade under eight minutes. The guitar riff on “Guerrilla Funk” wouldn’t sound outta place on Brant’s most recent record, although this one’s another extended cut, clocking it at 7:20, that throws in some bongos and at least one drum solo. The songs do get shorter from there, however.

After shuffling, three-and-a-half-minute cut “Mexico City Blues,” and a 43-second drum solo interlude, “Black & White Wonderland” offers a mellow, pleasant-sounding detour. This could be in the soundtrack to some National Geographic special or something. And speaking of soundtracks, the funky stomp of “Oui” could probably appear retroactively in a 70’s skin flick. Groovy!
