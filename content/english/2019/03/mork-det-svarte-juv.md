When such an arbiter of good taste as the mighty Fenriz endorses a band you can be sure they are something special, and indeed Mork are special.

Black metal in the best sense of the word, the songs herein take the listener on a journey through the soundscape of the soul. For sure there are nods to the greats like Darkthrone and Celtic Frost, which is as it should be, but overall Mork’s sound is their own.

The production is just right, and the emotions contained within run the full range of human experience.

This is music made by a man not afraid to look into the abyss and for listeners similarly unafraid.

(Peaceville)
