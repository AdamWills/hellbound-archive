On a hot Friday night, 08 March in Tonhalle, München, Godsmack and Like a Storm delivered an electric performance in front of a sold out crowd.

New Zealand rockers **Like A Storm** charged onstage at the start of the show, playing their signature didgeridoo instrument from the beginning. The band is tight: a solid set proves why they're considered one of the most promising young rock bands out there.

Like A Storm got out of the gates running, and played their hit track from the new album _Catacombs_ called “Pure Evil,” a six-minute masterpiece which served as great insight about what to expect from the band.

The band features a wide display of heavy riffs combined with slower parts, and vocalist Chris Brooks' multi-level vocal abilities, along with his brother Matt who was excellent on lead guitar, and has a great part in many of the band’s songs as a vocalist too. Their other brother Kent on bass and backing vocals make up the family unit that was joined by Zach Wood on drums.

The band finished their set with one of their biggest hits, “I Love The Way You Hate Me,” with Chris getting off the stage and joining the crowd to sing the last verse. All the die-hard rock fans who braved the treacherous  
weather joined in the singalong and it really showed the amazing showmanship by the band, keeping everybody engaged from start to finish.

**Godsmack** took the stage just after 10:00 p.m., and right away, they had the presence of a band with history and skill. Sully Erna and the band are on the road armed with a new album, _When Legends Rise_, and they performed a number of tracks off that set, including their latest No. 1 rock hit, “Bulletproof,” as well as older Godsmack material.

A signature of Godsmack's concerts is the dual drum solo between Larkin and the vocalist Sully Erna, which got the public very enthusiastic.

It was a fantastic evening and I am definitely looking forward to catch another of the their shows.
