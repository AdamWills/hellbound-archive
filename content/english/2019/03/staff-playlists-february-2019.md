This month, in honour of Valentine's day, we've added an extra category to spread the love. We've also added a category for all you Anti-Valentiners out there. Come accompany the humans of Hellbound this time around for their picks, recommendations and hearts full of Metal.

## Hellbound recommends

### Bill Adams

**New release**: Royal Trux - _White Stuff._ Okay, so White Stuff isn’t out yet (it’ll be released on March 1st), but I’ve been listening to it a lot as I complete a review of the album. You’re gonna love it -- Royal Trux’s first album of new material since 1997’s Sweet Sixteen sees the band incorporating digital and pop songwriting and production techniques into their fetid sewer stew, which creates a fantastic and fantastically weird mixture of hi-fi, low-fi, incredibly dirty and remarkably clean sonics. Find this record when it comes out! You will not regret it.

**Live:** I haven’t caught a show yet this year, but I’ve been listening to Rust Never Sleeps by Neil Young and Crazy Horse a lot, and it was recorded at least partially live — does that count?

**Non-Metal:** Yup, most of the stuff on my list is. Thanks for noticing.

**Wild card:** The Old Firm Casuals - _Holger Danske._ After a solid amount of time up on blocks, a recent reissue campaign renewed interest in the sound of Lars Frederiksen’s “other” band, and so they’ve answered that interest with new music which comes surprisingly close to sounding like a concept album. Complete with reoccurring sonic movements which knit the album together and a (sort-of) consistent theme which revolves around Frederiksen’s European roots, listeners will get the sense that this album is intended to be a timeless work in that it avoids timely cliches and incorporates as many sounds as it can (including writing that ventures close to Motorhead, some which comes close to AC/DC and some which actually touches quadrants of Led Zep’s catalogue too) and still manages to keep it focused. The album’s digital release if February 15, and the CD/vinyl comes out on March 15 — so check it out.

**Valentine:** AC/DC - _Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap_ (vinyl): I recently came into a copy of Dirty Deeds… which plays perfectly and was originally released in 1976. This was a party album and copies got run into the ground! I can only guess that the previous owner of my copy was supremely unpopular and I reap the rewards.

**Anti-Valentine:** This Means War - _Heartstrings._ After releasing a really solid EP in 2017, This Means War has returned with an excellent helping of the same sort of melodic hardcore which won fans the first time. That’s right, it’s more of the same buzzsaw and bark, and anybody who knows this band knows that’s all it needs to be in order to be great.

### Steve Earles

**New Release:** Venom - _Storm The Gates_. We'll soon have a second album from Venom Inc; I wonder how it will hold up to this decent offering from the Cronos-led version of Venom?

**Non-metal:** _I'm A Freak Baby 2._ Fantastic compilation of proto-metal and underground tracks from the late 60s, early 70s, lovingly compiled by Cherry Red Records. You can't argue with a boxset that includes the mighty Budgie!

**Non metal:** _Lamb - Best of 1996-2004_. Strange and wonderful.

**Wild Card:** _Bob Marley: Conquering Lion of Reggae_ by Stephen Davis. Reading this amazing book, you see how materialist and misognystic so much popular music has become. Bob Marley was the antithesis of the bling culture; it's a shame more pop singers don't take inspiration from him.

**Valentine:** Crumbling Ghost - _Crumbling Ghost II_. Beautiful timeless music.

**Anti-Valentine:** Motorhead - _Ace of Spades_

### Arta Gailuma

**Live:** Polyphia. Even though instrumental, I'm telling ya, these guys live are amazing! For those into Prog Metal, Polyphia will be touring the states in April/May. [https://youtu.be/7C19ZGLuhlQ](https://youtu.be/7C19ZGLuhlQ)

### Matt Hinch

**Listening to:** I've been having a rough go recently so I've been finding solace in the works of Colour Haze and Pelican. All of them. As few words as possible helps sometimes.

**New release:** Yatra - _Death Ritual._ Do you like your doom on the dirty side with a sludgy element and some psych for added colour? Take advantage of that legal weed and you sure will! [http://yatradoom.bandcamp.com/album/death-ritual-2](http://yatradoom.bandcamp.com/album/death-ritual-2)

**Live:** I missed the CoC/Crowbar show in Toronto but I am going to see K. Trevor Wilson March 1.

**Non-Metal:** Gary Clark Jr.'s newest (This Land) is a blend of blues, soul, R&B, hip-hop, reggae, Motown, and rock. Great guitarist and catchy tunes. [https://open.spotify.com/album/6pwdy6oQdwSQo8XOfpfAJJ?si=pHlshozHQSCowOWKefkjHw](https://open.spotify.com/album/6pwdy6oQdwSQo8XOfpfAJJ?si=pHlshozHQSCowOWKefkjHw)

**Wild card:** I should be listening to the new Candlemass album soon. And I'm anxiously awaiting the new one from The Budos Band. Hopefully it's as good as the single.
