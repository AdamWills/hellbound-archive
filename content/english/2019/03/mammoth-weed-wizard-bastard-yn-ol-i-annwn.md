This is the third album from the splendidly named **Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard**. No band sounds like M.W.W.B.; they are a secret the world needs to know. For sure, there are reference points, such as Black Sabbath and Hawkwind (and the musical spirit of adventure that Hawkwind represent is something far more bands should take onboard for themselves to be sure).

But in line with the album’s, title which means ‘Return To The Underworld’ in the band’s native Welsh, it’s clear M.W.W.B. are equally inspired by their country’s beautiful landscapes and haunting history and mythology. The Underworld is a major part of Celtic belief: ‘As Above, So Below’, the Underworld is a mirror image of our world.

I am reading an excellent book called ‘_Celtic Women_’ by Peter Berresford Ellis, and it really complements this album so well, a pleasing coincidence.

So, the heaviest of riffs are juxtaposed with passages of extreme haunting beauty, and Jessica Ball’s voice is just so beautiful, heartfelt and unique.

We need more bands like M.W.W.B, and we are very lucky to have them. As Above, So Below indeed.
