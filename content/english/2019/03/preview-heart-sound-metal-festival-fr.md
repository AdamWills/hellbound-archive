The fourth edition of **Heart Sound Metal Fest** takes place Saturday, April 6th, 2019, in Sucy-en-Brie (near Paris, France). Since its creation in 2014, Heart Sound Metal Fest (HSMF) has been donating all festival profits to a local organization dedicated to fighting leukaemia: [Ensemble contre les leucemies](https://www.facebook.com/Association-ensemble-contre-les-leuc%C3%A9mies-143925272971229/).

This year's HSMF line-up features seven nationally and internationally acclaimed bands representing tech and progressive metal, djent, deathcore and hardcore. Highlights include Danish powerhouse **VOLA**, Swedish dark deathcore act **Humanity’s Last Breath** (exclusive and first appearance in Paris) and Norwegian geniuses **Leprous**. French metal acts complete the line-up: **Stomb**, **The Dali Thundering Concept** and local band **Promethean.**

Recently Einar Solberg, front man of Leprous, announced a unique performance for the festival: a shuffle live set. The audience will draw tracks from a box and the band will perform them on the spot. It is a format that Leprous has never done before and an exclusive for the festival.

### Metal versus Leukemia

Heart Sound Metal Fest raised 5000€ for Ensemble contre les Leucémies in 2017 and they're hoping to donate at least the same amount or even more this year.

Donations help the organization offer services like:

- Providing moral and material support to patients and their families.
- Improving hospital conditions and helping out two Parisian hospitals: Robert-Debré and Armand Trousseau.
- Raising public awareness about leukaemia, and especially about blood, platelets, stem cells, bone marrow and umbilical cord donations, and enroll more people on the national Donor Registry.
- Supporting medical research to find more efficient treatments.
