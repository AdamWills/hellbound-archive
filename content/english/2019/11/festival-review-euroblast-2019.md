## 27-29 September, Essigfabrik Cologne, Germany

Euroblast Festival is an annual showcase for the best in progressive & tech metal, featuring young and upcoming artists as well as ones that already reign the scene – or, as festival organizers say: "Call it Prog, Tech, Death, Post or just - well - music; we like it virtuous, experimental and mind blowing." Many bands like Uneven Structure, Destiny Potato, and The Algorithm have taken their first steps on this festival's stages. And previous festival editions have hosted many influential names like Meshuggah, Textures, Animals As Leaders, Devin Townsend Project, Tesseract, and Sikth, just few to mention.

Euroblast's 15th edition took place on 27-29 September 2019 at Essigfabrik Cologne, Germany.

Day 1 headliners were German progressive metallers **The Hirsch Effekt**.
