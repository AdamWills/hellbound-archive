It’s fair to say that Killer are the most influential of all Belgian heavy metal bands (Belgian metal is highly underrated, check out the excellent ‘Death Penalty’ album on Rise Above which, guitar maestro Gaz Jennings aside, is an all Belgian line-up).

Formed in 1980 by the legendary Paul ‘Shorty’ Van Camp, Killer were very in tune with the then nascent New Wave Of British Heavy Metal that gave us Diamond Heavy, Iron Maiden, Angel Witch and Saxon (but don’t get me started on the NWOBHM as we’ll be here all day). Releasing such albums as ‘Wall of Sound’, ‘Shock Waves’ and ‘Fatal Attraction’, the band became cult heroes. All these albums can be found on Cherry Red’s fine collection ‘Killer Volume One - The Mausoleum Years Boxset 1980-1990’, which is a worthy addition to any metal fan’s collection.

Following a long hiatus the band reformed in the 2ist century with such albums as ‘Broken Silence’, ‘Immortal’ and the aptly named ‘Monsters of Rock’. All are fine albums, the first two showing more classic rock influences than before, but this is no bad thing.

As a welcome added bonus Cherry Red have added Van Camp’s rare 1988 solo album ‘Too Wild To Tame’, which will appeal to anyone who loves the 80s! (everyone at the moment, judging by ‘American Horror Story ’84, ‘Joker’ and ‘Stranger Things’!)

Overall, a great value for money boxset!
