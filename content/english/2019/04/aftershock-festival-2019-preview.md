Well, it’s that time of year again where [Aftershock Festival](https://aftershockfestival.com/) has been announced and it is another stacked line up. October 11th\-13th at Discovery Park in Sacramento California will be the place to be for all things Rock and Heavy Metal.

This year marks the 8th installment of the Festival and will see headliners that include **Slipknot**, **Staind**, **Blink 182**, **Rob Zombie**, **Tool** and **Korn**. It will also showcase such acts as **Lamb of God**, **Clutch**, **Baby Metal**, **Bad Religion**, **Marilyn Manson**, **Philip H. Anselmo and the Illegals**, **Chevelle**, **Gojira** and **Stone Temple Pilots** plus a ton more.

Year after year, Aftershock Festival continuously strives to bring the best and some of the heaviest music on the planet to Northern California, and once again the organizers are doing just that. With three stages to choose from and such a diverse line up, there is always something for everyone.

I have been lucky enough in my time to have attended a number of festivals in North America, and Aftershock is by far the premier Music Festival on the West Coast.  The weather, the music, the location, the food and the people make it a truly wonderful experience.  Set among the trees in beautiful Discovery Park in Sacramento California, with a staked line up like this, how can anyone who loves Rock or Metal not want to attend? 

Tickets on sale Friday April 26th.
