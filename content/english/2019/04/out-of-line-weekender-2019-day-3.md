## Astra Kulturhaus - Berlin, Germany

Out Of Line Weekender 2019 edition was taking place on 04.-06. April at Astra Kulturhaus Berlin, Germany. The three day affair was covering electronic, techno and various heavy metal genres.

_Check out our coverage of [Day 1](https://www.hellbound.ca/?p=36251) and [Day 2](https://www.hellbound.ca/?p=36253)._

### Day 3 in review

The last day of Out Of Line Weekender was a pure heavy metal day that started with Italian symphonic death metal band **Genus Ordinis Dei** taking the stage.

Danish progressive thrash/ death metal band **Xenoblight** is a relatively new band to the scene and have brought out their first record _Procreation_ only in 2018. At first sight it seemed like yet another formulaic female fronted band, but, oh boy, they were hitting us hard with their heavy riffs and the throaty vocals of the band's frontwoman Marika Hyldmar were incredibly brutal and more black metal like.

As next we saw Finnish melodic/folk metallers **Frosttide**. With their melodic, yet heavy sound these guys have been on my radar for some time and live they did not disappoint.

Another Finnish band on the line up were melodic death/thrash metallers **Bloodred Hourglass**. Splattering all over the stage the water being poured over their heads after every few songs and eager to let the energy go wild, they delivered quite an intriguing set.

Next we had Swedish progressive metal quintet **Evergrey** taking the stage. They kicked off with the beautiful 8-minute long "A Silent Arc" from their latest record _The Atlantic_ which was released in January 2019. The rest of the set focused mainly on previous albums and we were treated to some fan favourites like "A Touch of Blessing".

It seems like  **Die Apokalyptischen Reiter**, generally speaking, have been quite a German affair, but I am glad they are getting  the popularity outside the country's borders. The German quintet is known for creative, colourful and wild live shows. The frontman Fuchs was changing the outfits during the show and jumping around and at some point gigantic inflatable balls started to glide above our heads.

Melodic death metallers **Dark** **Tranquillity** did close Out Of Line Weekender 2019 in style. Considered by many as one of the pioneering acts of Gothenburg metal scene, the Swedes nailed down another amazing show. One of the most anticipated acts of the night did not leave us disappointed – these guys are a real powerhouse and the over an hour long set consisted of pieces from most of their discography. Mikael Stanne has to be one of the most charismatic frontmen in heavy metal world; he was tirelessly interacting with the crowd and didn't need to lift a finger for fans to go wild.
