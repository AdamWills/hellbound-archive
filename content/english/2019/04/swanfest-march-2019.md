## Swanfest @ City National Grove, Anaheim, California, March 30, 2019

First Swanfest, 2019, and can’t wait for many more to come. When you first arrive General Admission already had a line going around not one but two corners. The VIP line was fairly long too, but both lines moved along quickly to get everyone in the event.

Walking into the event you noticed two stages: to your right is Stage 2 and to your left is Stage 1. The event consisted of 16 bands: 9 bands played on Stage 1, while the other 7 played on Stage 2. Since the majority of the bands I wanted to shoot were on Stage 1, I mainly stayed in that area. However, I was still able to see a few Stage 2 bands perform and they did amazing.

Stage 2 had a great lineup: Wolf & Bear, Thousand Below, Royal Coda, Eidola, Strawberry Girls, Covet, and Hail The Sun.

At Stage 1 there was: Sianvar, Volumes, Intervals, Veil Of Maya, Don Broco, We Came As Romans, Crown The Empire, Periphery, and Dance Gavin Dance.

Swanfest did a great job of who they wanted to perform at this event and the crowd couldn’t agree more.
