Metal-on-Metal is a superb label. I haven’t encountered anything from them yet that wasn’t first class, and **Nomad Son** are no exception.

Hailing from Malta, an island that produces a lot of fine metal bands (particularly in proportion to its population!), Nomad Sun play extremely proficient heavy metal, to my mind NWOBHM influenced with the energy of 80s thrash metal.

The song-writing, playing and production are first class, and this album is well worth purchasing by anyone who truly loves heavy metal.
