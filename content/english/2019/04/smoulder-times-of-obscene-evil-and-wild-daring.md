Epic doom is alive and well in 2019! Not only do we have a new Candlemass, with Johan Langqvist—and a guest appearance from Iommi—but there are also a few new outfits eschewing bongs and wizards for swords and sorcery, all in the name of doom. Among this new wave of heaviness is Toronto’s **Smoulder**, who have damn near sold out every copy of their debut album, _Times of Obscene Evil and Wild Daring_.

This six-song effort begins with “Ilian of Garathorm,” which opens with church bells and swirling effects before laying down the doom for six and a half minutes. The soaring, epic leads recall the German power doom of Atlantean Kodex, before they settle into a melodic, mid-paced chug, complete with vicious female vocals that deliver the tales of battle and triumph. “The Sword Woman” is a slower, doomier effort with a plodding tempo that recalls Candlemass and vocals that really soar above the mix. “Bastard Steel” picks up the pace into vintage speed-metal territory, a six-minute ripper with some killer _Painkiller_ riffs and an epic chorus.

“Voyage of the Sunchaser” has the most extended evil intro on the album, a plodding, pulsing, slice of heightened anxiety backed by a tribal drumbeat. A stop-start section kicks in around the 1:45 mark signaling a change in tempo to some more mid-paced, riff-forward fare. The more compact “Shadowy Sisterhood” starts off in mid-tempo power/doom territory; this one’s a rumbling, straight-ahead chugger that’s over in just under four and a half minutes.

Album closer “Black God’s Kiss” delivers the doom metal epic we’ve been waiting for, a shade over nine minutes of brooding misery and existential dread, with a touch of Reverend Bizarre. Most bands don’t write ‘em like that anymore…
