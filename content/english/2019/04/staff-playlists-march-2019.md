Spring has began to sprung (at least for those of you in the northern hemisphere). Join the ones of hellbound this month to see what they've been givin' some love to as we bring in these warmer months.

## Hellbound recommends

### Steve Earles

**Listening to:** Albert Bell's Sacro Sanctus - _Liber III: Codex_ _Templarum._ Third and best Sacro Santus album. Inspired by Bathory, Venom and Celtic Frost (the Unholy Trinity). This is metal as it should be, with great songs, great performances and great production, and on the splendidly named Metal-On-Metal record label, it doesn't get more metal than this. Legend!

**New Release:** Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard - _Yn Ol I Annwn._ That's Welsh for 'Return To The Underworld'. This band are crushingly heavy and soul-searing beautiful at the same time. They truly deserve to be heard.

**Live:** Saw some excellent live clips of Jefferson Airplane on Sky Arts.

**Non-metal:** The best of Glenn Miller

**Wild Card:** That great occult horror film from 1958, _Night of the_ _Demon_, black-and-white, great story from M.R James, and a character (Karlswell) based on Aleister Crowley, the Great Beast himself. We are not worthy (but we'll have to do).

### Arta Gailuma

**Listening to:** I'm in Devin mode right now. I've always been a huge fan of his work. The latest album is different from his previous work, but it's Devy Metal, so different and crazy is always expected.

**New release:** Devin Townsend - _Empath_ out March 29th, 2019. [https://devin-townsend.lnk.to/EmpathID](https://devin-townsend.lnk.to/EmpathID)

**Live:** The Ocean. This band pulls off such a great live show, it's unbelievable. [https://theocean.bandcamp.com](https://theocean.bandcamp.com/)

### Gene Gaona

**Listening to:** The best of Type O Negative

**New release:** Exhumer -  _Hostile Defiance_. Metal Blade Records release date April 5th, 2019

**Live:** Daron Malakian and Scars on Broadway at Slims in San Francisco March 6th, 2019

**Non-Metal:** Hank Williams Sr. - 40 Greatest Hits

**Wild card:** Counting down the day until I’m back in the beautiful city of Montreal for 4 days to enjoy some friends, beers and Heavy Montreal!

### Gruesome Greg

**Listening to:** Brainoil - _Death to this Dry Season_

**New release:** High Reeper - _Higher Reeper_

**Live:** Graveyard / Uncle Acid @ Danforth Music Hall, March 30th

**Non-Metal:** The Greg Kihn Band - _The Breakup Song (They Don't Write 'Em)_

**Wild card:** My bracket was dead last in my March Madness pool after the first round. #NotEnoughUpsets2019

### Matt Hinch

**Listening to:** I've been screaming along with Chino while listening to _Adrenaline_ by Deftones lately. That album will never get old!

**New release:** Magic Circle - _Departed Souls_ (20 Buck Spin) It's been a while since we've heard from these trad doom/hard rockers but the wait was worth it. Triumphant! Plus, the vocalist sometimes reminds me of Kyle Thomas (Exhorder, Trouble, ex-Alabama Thunderpussy) and that's never a bad thing.

**Non-Metal:** Still circling back around to Gary Clark Jr. every now and again. I like his guitar style.

**Wild card:** The new season of _Star Trek: Discovery_ has me hooked. I'm more of a Star Wars guy but I'm not against good sci-fi. Also anxiously awaiting the final season of _Game of Thrones_. I think I heard rumblings of a spin-off show based back when dragons ruled Westeros. I'm on the fence about the whole idea. It would have to be GOOD not to be overkill.

### Sarah Riley

**Listening to:** 1\. Mastodon - _March of the Fire Ants_ (Remission, Relapse Records, 2002) 2. Cephalic Carnage - _When I Arrive_ (Misled by Certainty, Relapse Records, 2010) Super addicting tune, I've probably listened to it at least 100 times over the past few days. A grindcore/death band with a jazz spinoff creates a really unique sound.

**New Release:** Nightrage - _Wolf to Man_ (Despotz Records. March 29th, 2019). The album released previous to this (_The Venomous_, 2017) set a high bar for me with any _Nightrage_ music to come, because of the fact that it was just that friggin good. This new album surpassed my expectations.  [https://nightrage.bandcamp.com](https://nightrage.bandcamp.com)

**Live:** Cerbearus, Psychotic Pulse, Cathartic Demise @ The Boathouse, March 8th.

**Non-Metal:** Flatbush Zombies - _Chunky_ (Vacation in Hell, Glorious Dead Recordings, 2018) [https://youtu.be/7TVqOsUBr2I](https://youtu.be/7TVqOsUBr2I)

**Wildcard:** The Hogtown Vegan, Toronto. The BEST vegan Mac & Cheese you'll ever have... EVER.

### Adam Wills

**Listening to:** Haken - _Visions_

**New release:** Devin Townsend - _Empath_ (InsideOut Records)

**Live:** Deafheaven / Baroness / Zeal & Ardor - Toronto
