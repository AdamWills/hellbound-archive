## Astra Kulturhaus - Berlin, Germany

Out Of Line Weekender 2019 edition was taking place on 04.-06. April at Astra Kulturhaus Berlin, Germany. The three day affair was covering electronic, techno and various heavy metal genres.

_**Check out our coverage of**_ _[**Day 1**](https://www.hellbound.ca/?p=36251) **and [Day 3](https://www.hellbound.ca/?p=36254).**_

### Day 2 in review

Friday night started with **Incubite** DJ set performed by producer and Erdling frontman Neill Freiwald. Incubite was a German techno project and a brainchild of Neill. Even though the band does not exist anymore, their songs are still part of worldwide club playlists and performed by Neill.

The Swedish band **Rave The Reqviem** was created in 2011 with the idea to combine metal with modern electronic- industrial, dubstep, drum'n'bass and melodic, gothic elements with adding female soprano voice.

They were greeted on stage with loud applause and cheering and playing for the first time in Germany, I think, they did feel very welcomed.

The band's female vocalist The Seraph unfortunately was not able to make the show and Swedish musical theatre actress [Saga Björklund Jönsson](https://www.facebook.com/saga.b.jonsson?fref=mentions&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA0RY27uzM4Q-hMkn4yZRmIhUU-uVrd8oliyfI9w2ucEkLPXqwbFKlyxZ-YqgtgG_C9WLBPeZq6xB3j4seweOxVfAyfCsd4q2uPA5LZoQDDIREYKe5UMjlDA7YzHHkyEzVeu8P2OJWMp-0JF5eMLKpCBoE9vrLQ7R3gDy88u1l3IIlqpvetGNsDQKsbNevyfkWRc_8uZnaOxjK7W6ueUCPXHpOpVPiVUfkDXE_HLti_ynqDyzvfUSVfVg-isXWGgS1CxBcWg2IzkGUyMEV38H36F68fDhFVAkF51zOsEblxSgLQQN_howdPnZqkpopg6U17BrP7vbqG-0AP6w&__tn__=K-R) did do a great job standing in for her at the festival.

Marketed as melodic/industrial death metal band, **Fear Of Domination** label themselves as shock metal. Even though the previous bands were well received from fans, these Finns, known for crazy live shows, started the real madness here tonight. People were headbanging, fist-pumping, hair was flying and somewhere in the depths of the crowd a moshpit was building. The energy that this band was able to create amongst themselves and pass over to fans was just unbelievable.

Another band with staggeringly energetic live performance was Finnish five piece **Blind Channel**. The young men, all dressed in white, were jumping around the stage like crazy and the crowd was following their example.

Next ones up on the stage were German industrial metallers, ex Stahlmann members **Erdling** with their heavy, yet very danceable melodies.

First headliners tonight were German metalcore act **Eskimo Callboy**. It seemed like this band is steering their boat in the direction of pop metal, but nevertheless, the crowd was enjoying their fancy smoke and confetti displays and the boyband style catchy sing- along choruses.

Then a massive skull head appeared on stage followed by a pair of skeleton hands and it was time for the last band of the night and the second headliner- Mexican dark electronic duo **Hocico**. The two cyber- punks were doing what they do best and twisted synth melodies were filling the room.
