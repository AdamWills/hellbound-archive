Speaking of doom metal comebacks… **Ogre**, kings of the Portland doom scene (Portland, Maine, that is) have returned with their fifth album, roughly five and a half years after its predecessor, [_The Last Neanderthal_](https://hellbound.ca/2014/04/ogre-last-neanderthal/). I have been a fan since I first heard their 2008 “last-ever” album, _Plague of the Planet_ – or more precisely, portions of it played live at a Rochester doom fest in 2009. Despite the large gap between recent releases, suffice to say the doom scene is better off with this trio than without them.

_Thrice as Strong_ gets off to a jaunty start with “The Future,” channelling the mystical, magical output of Pagan Altar…particularly in the vocal department. (Not that the guy from Magic Circle did a bad job on their last tour, but Ogre’s Ed Cunningham is pretty much the perfect replacement for Terry Jones!) The proto-doom machine rolls on with “Hive Mind,” an uptempo, boogie rocker that falls somewhere between Mountain and (non-instrumental) Earthless, albeit not without its own doomy, heavy breakdowns. “Big Man” throws another heavy 70’s riff out there, with more of a gritty, bluesy, ZZ Top feel – fuzzy guitars not included.

“Judgement Day” chugs along like a Mel Gibson biker movie, with a doomy stomping section that starts around the 3:30 mark. The eight-and-a-half-minute “Blood of Winter” slows things down significantly, wallowing in the gloomy tempos of a Saint Vitus, before picking up the pace to a steady gallop around the five-minute mark…not unlike an early Saint Vitus. ?

The opening bassline of “King of the Wood” is very reminiscent of “Dragonaut,” and while it takes a slightly different turn from there, this tune is still pretty slow ‘n Sleepy. “Cyber-Czar” ends things on an epic note, another 8:30ish number that incorporates some of the storytelling elements of _Plague of the Planet_, driven home by a soaring Cirith Ungol vocal. Still going strong after all these years!
