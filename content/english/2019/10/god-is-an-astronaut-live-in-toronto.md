## @ the Opera House with Depression Era, 27 September 2019

**God Is An Astronaut** filled the Opera House on Friday night with gloom and melancholia, touring their new album '_Epitaph_'. A packed crowd stood in awe as the post-rock veterans played songs from their entire catalog with overwhelming energy. With the sound being impeccable, the lights exploding in all the right places and stories being told on-stage about their songwriting, it was one of their best performances to date.
