I was fairly impressed with [_Beyond the Sun_, the 2017 debut](https://hellbound.ca/2017/04/woodhawk-beyond-sun/) from Calgary heavy rock band Woodhawk – they [blew the roof off the Bovine](https://hellbound.ca/2018/03/concert-photos-woodhawk-mountaindust-hawkeyes-loworbit/) when they played here the following year, too. So that would probably make this one of my most anticipated Canadian releases of 2019.

_Violent Nature_ kicks off with the slithering riffs of “Snake in the Grass,” which comes crawling up slowly before striking with a venomous fuzz-riffy attack, and a soaring, fist-raising chorus. “Weightless Light” gets my head nodding right away with a solid stoner rock riff, while giving off a pretty decent Monster Truck vibe in the chorus – I can see why they made it the pre-release single.

“Dry Blood” offers a similarly soaring vocal, with a catchy, albeit repetitive chorus, and its riffs are a bit choppier. “Heartstopper” is another variation on the theme – a more polished, if not unappealing, take on riff-rock…it even has a slow, mellow section. In “Old Silence,” it’s the chorus that takes a more melodic turn. Down the homestretch, they do find a decent balance between heavy grooves and lighter passages on the title track and “As a Friend,” although I could still go for a little more oomph.

Overall, this just doesn’t grab me as much as their first record did. While more radio-friendly, it’s a little lacking in the heavy groove department. I’d probably still go and see ‘em live if they came back to Toronto, though…
