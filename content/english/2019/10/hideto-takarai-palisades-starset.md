## Divisions Tour @ The Regent Theater, Los Angeles

### October 2, 2019 

**Hideto Takarai**, stage name **Hyde**, is a Japanese musician, singer, songwriter, producer, and actor from Wakayama, Japan. Known for his lead vocals from L’Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps, and now he has his solo career that is sky rocketing. Hyde is an amazing Alternative Hard Rock performer and concert showed it. When he came out with the rest of the group is was black lights and glowing masks. The interaction with the crowd was more than amazing. He made everyone be a part of his performance and put on an incredible show. Glowing eyes and hair made capturing photos that much more fun. If Hyde is in your area, go see him and rock out.

**Palisades**, an American Post-Hardcore band from Iselin, New Jersey, formed in 2011. Consisting of members Louis “Lou” Miceli Jr. (lead vocals), Xavier Adames (lead guitar, backing vocals), Matthew Marshall (rhythm guitar), Brandon Elgar (bass guitar, backing and co-lead vocals), and Aaron Rosa (drums). Sadly, Lou was not there at the show because of voice and sinus issues, and some inner-ear issues as well. Bassist Brandon, however, took on the role of lead singer for the night and did amazing. Their performance was great with how they interacted with the crowd, as well as each other. The crowd was loving each and every song that was performed, and who could blame them. This band has done some great things and there are many more to come.

**Starset**, an American Rock band from Columbus, Ohio, formed in 2013. Members consist of Dustin Bates (lead vocals), Ron DeChant (bass), Brock Richards (lead guitar), Adam Gilbert (drums), Siobhán Cronin (violin, keyboards), and Mariko Muranaka Friend (cello). This bands style would be described as characters from Wasteland, but it fits with how they’ve progressed through their music. They had a quick fifteen-minute intermission for a costume change back to their previous look. They came out in their astronaut suits and the crowd was beyond ecstatic. The fans of this band are dedicated through and through. Starset has made their name and they only continue to do amazing things; they perform like there’s no tomorrow.
