## Voyager with Verb the Noun, Axiom and Coldbones

### 24.09.2019 @ The Flapper, Birmingham, UK

The evening started with **Verb the Noun**, a local Birmingham memey metalcore band taking the stage.

Next band featured was **Axiom**, a Birmingham trio playing instrumental progressive rock. With the skilfully composed melodic passages mixed with heavy, totally headbangable rhythms and the delightful chatting and jokes between the songs a good time was here was guaranteed.

I do have to say I wasn't familiar with any of tonight's supporting bands including next one, **Coldbones** which, as most in the room knew to tell, would be great to see live. And they were totally right. Band's Facebook story says: "Combining elements of prog, shoegaze, metal and atmospheric soundscapes, Coldbones present a fresh and engaging take on post rock".  With all lights cut and only three flashing led strips on the floor the fully instrumental set felt airy and very atmospheric.

And then it was time for **Voyager**. Delightful and energetic as always, the Aussies were going through all fan favourites like "Hyperventilating", and also included in their set some new pieces from upcoming album _Colours in the Sun_ (out on 1 November 2019 via Season of Mist). With their pop infused melodies and fun shows Voyager is easily one of the most entertaining live bands whose music would appeal to lovers of different genres.
