Once again Cherry Red unleash a fine collection of vintage 45s on double CD as picked by Lux and Ivy from The Cramps.

Released at just the right time of the year, this fine compilation is a great antidote to the humdrum Halloween music compilations released at this time of the year (do we really need to hear the ‘Ghostbusters’ theme again!!?).

This collection has been put together with love and knowledge. And any compilation featuring Screamin’ Jay Hawkins and Bo Diddley has to be worth your money.

With this collection, every day can be Halloween!
