## The Troubling And Distracting Specter of Stoker’s Vampire On Screen

### By Simon Bacon

#### Published by McFarland

This an excellent book exploring the role of Dracula as the ultimate outsider: like a dark mirror image (ironically) of the period of time the films featured in this book reflect.

The remit of this intelligently written book is broad, going beyond Dracula into the realm of such films as David Cronenberg’s _Rabid_, _Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein_, _Blade_, _The Last Man On Earth_, _Ex Machina_ and _Jupiter Ascending_! (A film I actually like!).

I particularly enjoyed Simon’s writing on _Daybreakers_, one of my all-time favourite vampire films.

Overall, an intelligent and thought provoking book.
