Hellbound.ca is happy to present, "Erosion," a new song from Bonnyville, Alberta's **Silent Line**. The band will release _Shattered Shores_ – their "first attempt" at a concept album – on Oct 30. According to Silent Line, _Shattered Shores_ "depicts a tortured island stuck in time being slowly worn away by an endless ocean." The album's second track, "Erosion," is set in a land free of snow, being burned away by an inferno," says the band. "Fear dominates. The past and how the land has come to be a ruined hellscape is the main subject matter."
