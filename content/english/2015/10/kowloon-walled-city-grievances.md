I had read somewhere that **Kowloon Walled City**'s new album, _Grievances__,_ is a concept album about office culture, workplace conflict and the rat race. You get a bit of a sense of that in the lyrics, but had I not been alerted beforehand, I probably wouldn’t have picked up on it—post-sludge often tends to be cryptic, and its songs rarely lyric-driven.

The same press release lauded this as being a softer, more accessible Kowloon Walled City. Their last album, _Container Ships_, reminded me of Neurosis and the Melvins, so I’m not surprised to see they’ve signed to Neurot. Musically, _Grievances_ begins with the loud airing of “Your Best Years,” which hits pretty heavy with some pounding post-sludge riffage. The title track takes a similar tact, albeit with some big, crunchy bass featuring prominently. The repeated refrain of “Celebrate” sticks with you… What can it possibly mean?

After a few songs, the pace is pretty much set as plodding post-sludge, with very little in the way of tempo changes. I take it these guys have never worked in a fast-paced office environment. ;)
