**Limb** play excellent stripped down stoner-doom, with more than a hint of Corrosion of Conformity and Motorhead. Another plus on the band's second album, _Terminal_, is an excellent concise yet organic production from the legendary Russ Russell; he has truly captured the essence of the band.

Moreover, Limb’s song-writing is first class (all bands without songs should quit, we’re sick of them!). There’s a real 70s influence amongst all the monolithic (baby!) riffing, which is splendid to listen to.

Fantastic band, the real deal!
