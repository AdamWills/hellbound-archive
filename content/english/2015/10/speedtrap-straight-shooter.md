Reviews I’m seen for this simply splendid album seem to focus on two bands as influences on Speedtrap, Motorhead and Chrome Division (I don’t see them as an influence but they share attitudes and influences).

For sure I hear Motorhead, which is as it should be, if you don’t love Motorhead, you don’t love life. But Motorhead aside, the biggest influence on this album has got to be classic Venom! Because Venom had a hell (sorry!) of a lot of punk and rock n’ roll influences. Seriously, classic Venom are brilliant, and again, if you don’t love Venom…

Indeed it does not surprise me that these Finns will be appearing in October at the Live Evil Festival in London in October, they are such a Fenriz band, and he is a man of impeccable taste. Speedtrap have the chops and energy of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, and also the speed of the classic thrash bands of the 80s.

Simply brilliant music, uplifting, ferocious, with great songs and style.

What more could any true music fan want?
