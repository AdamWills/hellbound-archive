Napalm made a very good decision in signing **Unleash The Archers**: they have all of metal’s strengths and none of it’s weaknesses.

_Time Stands Still_ is a very positive, very up album. In some respects, it is very traditional – great playing, great songwriting – but in other’s – production and influences – it is very modern.

The icing on a very tasty metal cake has to be incredible vocals of the splendidly named Brittney Slayes, distinct, heartfelt and impassioned, truly giving Unleash The Archers a great identity of their own.

The next big thing methinks!
