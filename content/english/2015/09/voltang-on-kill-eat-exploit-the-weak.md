Several of us Hellbound folk moonlight as radio hosts, producers, volunteers and so on. You may already know this, and you may have had the good sense and/or good fortune to catch Gruesome Greg's [Gruesome Tunes](http://www.gripofdelusion.com/), Craig Hayes on the New Zealand airwaves, Kevi(metal) Stewart-Panko on [INDI 101](http://www.1015thehawk.ca/), or Adam and me hosting [Kill Eat Exploit the Weak](http://killeatexploittheweak.blogspot.ca/) on [CFMU](http://cfmu.msumcmaster.ca/). Or this may be news to you... and if so, well, you've been missing out.

[![voltang tour](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/voltang-tour-232x300.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/voltang-tour.jpg)Last night Adam and I did some last-minute finagling and ended up in the CFMU studio with a couple of special guests: Evan Dreager (guitar/vocals) and Paul Maxwell (drums) of Hamilton raunch'n'roll five-piece **[Voltang](http://voltang.com/)**.

The guys kept us company, provided some music commentary, gave us some insight into the world of a Hamilton-based DIY band, shared some of their own music, and talked about their September [Tabarnak and Back tour](https://www.facebook.com/raunchandroll/app_123966167614127), which wraps up this weekend with shows in Toronto (September 24 at the Bovine), [Hamilton (September 25 at Club Absinthe)](https://www.facebook.com/events/528039670683796/) and Barrie (September 26).

If you missed the 12-2am broadcast, all is not lost. You can check out the show archives at [cfmu.msumcmaster.ca](http://cfmu.msumcmaster.ca/) (Programming > Kill Eat Exploit the Weak > September 23).

In the meantime, you can take a gander at the video for "Hermaphrodite," the title track off the band's 2015 debut album.
