Here we have another interesting project from Salt Lake City. **Making Fuck** will draw some comparisons to their friends Subrosa but definitely have a sound and vibe all their own. This group consists of Kory Quist (guitars and vocals) (also of Ditch and the Delta), Jeff Wells (drums) and Jessica Bundy (cello).

There’re only two tracks here and on the first one – that being " A Slave To The Lazy Boy" – you can hear in the intro a fun sound clip from Kevin Smith's classic movie _Clerks_. This might be quite familiar to some and go over well with the stoner doom fan base.

The song has some slow riffing and punchy drums. Later the cello's swooping beauty and power kick in to lay waste to everything built around this group. The vocals here are rough and tough but are easily distinguishable with a nice post-hardcore feel or even post-metal, think early Isis. Later the song gets very hypnotic and continues to get more progressive with lots of tricky riffs that start and stop. Some might think this is the best helmet worship since early Isis but later when Kory shouts the words “Addicted to Mediocrity" one can't but hear his passion for Scott Kelly and Neurosis shining through.

The second song "Hopefull Godless I" sets the tone with total destructive palm muted riffs that some could say descend upon the listener, making them feel as though the earth is being tore apart at its seems. Hmm, well, now that one thinks about it, this song would have been great as the soundtrack to the recent movie about the San Andrea's fault.

Here again we find the vocals are nice and burly with lots of yells. Another aspect of this is the catchiness as the tune really becomes its own after the drums fade and the devastating head nodding riffs take control.  One might say it makes the listener feel as though they are traveling down a tumbling train track toward world destruction.

Generally if the music fan is looking for something solid, catchy songs with sounds ranging from Isis, Neurosis and Helmet look no further than this band.
