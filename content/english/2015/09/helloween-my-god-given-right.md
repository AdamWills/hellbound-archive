There is indeed no happy medium with Euro-metal, either it is very good or very bad. Thankfully, on this album, Helloween are very good.

Musically, we have some great Iron Maiden-esque songs. One thing that sets Helloween apart from so many metal bands is there sense of humour ( "Dr. Stein" anyone?), which is still very evident. Highlights of _My God-Given Right_ include the title track, "Still Crazy" and "Lost In America."

Overall, an excellent and uplifting album.
