_A couple upcoming release picks from our Irish correspondent, Steve Earles:_

[Godreah Records](http://www.godreah.com/index2.php) will release a new [**Wolves of Avalon**](https://www.facebook.com/thewolvesofavalon) MCD this year entitled _Across A Twilight Field of Corpses Grey, Only The Trilling of Nightingales Can Be Heard_. Keep an eye out for it in February 2015.

This will include a 25-minute prog pagan epic track plus a cover of Venom's classic "Die Hard," which will feature several guest vocalists, including Rob Miller of the legendary **Amebix** and Mirai of **Sigh**, along with other demi-gods of the underground!

There will also be a [**Meads of Asphodel**](http://www.themeadsofasphodel.com/) split – with American band Tjolgtjar – appearing on a US label later this year.
