Unlike the vast number of their Pacific Northwest contemporaries, Portland, OR party kvlt **BEWITCHER** keep it simple, succinct and proudly Satanic. Eschewing lumbering, portentous doomdoomdoomDOOMYdoomdoomdoom in favour of a relentless, no nonsense speed metal attack, these lithe Bacchanal sonic sorcerers have conjured a confident, defiantly lo-fi sound. Over the course of their three demo EPs, hedonistic indifference to propriety and a concentrated dose of black speed delirium have been place squarely at the centre of BEWITCHER's campaign of infernal terror and burning debauchery.

Their latest three-song offering, _Midnight Hunters_ (Heretic Fire Records), available digitally and as a limited edition cassette, once again doesn't try to reinvent the Catherine wheel. Instead, shitkicking in Satan's unholy name is (still) the primary mission statement, as evidenced by headlong, self-explanatory riff-fuelled joyrides like "Speed Till You Bleed" and the title track. Navel-gazing, conceptually hirsute Stereogum fodder, this ain't, ICYMI.

Over before you even realize it, _Midnight Hunters_ is further proof that BEWITCHER are more than ready to assume their rightful place leading the rebellion at the gates of Heaven (BYOB).
