In 2013, Canada stepped up to compete in the international **[Wacken Metal Battle](http://www.metal-battle.com/)** competition, a contest for emerging metal bands that takes place alongside the annual **[Wacken Open Air](https://www.wacken.com/)** metal festival in Germany. In 2013, Canada also won the competition – or, more specifically, Toronto's [**Crimson Shadows**](https://crimsonshadows.bandcamp.com/) fought their way to the top while representing the vitality of a diverse Canadian metal scene. [Hellbound caught up with them after the fact](https://hellbound.ca/2014/02/canuck-metal-crimson-shadows/). We also had a chance to [interview the man who brought the Battle to Canada, JJ Tartaglia](https://hellbound.ca/2014/01/wmbc/). Now it's time to start it all again.

_From last week's WMBC announcement:_

**Wacken Metal Battle Canada** is proud to announce this year's line up of competing bands across the country in Victoria, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City.

"2015 is going to be our strongest year yet. More cities, more submissions, and more great Canadian metal. The chosen bands are looking very promising and I am especially excited for this year's edition," comments WMBC organizer JJ Tartaglia.

All bands competing are battling for one to rule them all and play at the world's largest metal fest Wacken Open Air in Wacken, Germany taking place from July 30th to August 1st. Toronto's Crimson Shadows (2013 winners - [video at Wacken](http://clicks.fanbridge.com/l.php?cid=1149212&sid=77802669&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRGnPfOeRwe4)) and Montreal's Mutank (2014 winners - [video at Wacken](http://clicks.fanbridge.com/l.php?cid=1149212&sid=77802669&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrJaymA4JipU)) have had that honour playing in front of thousands.

Each city will hold their qualifying rounds plus city finals from the months of January to May 2015 selecting the top band to move forward to the national finals in Toronto, ON in June (date to be determined) with one being selected to perform at the 26th edition of Wacken Open Air taking place from July 30th to August 1st. All bands will be judged during battle rounds by respected local music industry.

Initial rounds have already taken place (see the winners for these cities listed below) but there's lots more to come. Updates and event pages are easily accessible via the [Wacken Metal Battle Canada facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MetalBattleCanada).
