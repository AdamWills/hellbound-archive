Since unleashing the self-described "opus to \[the\] inherent filth of mankind," _Crippled Minds, Sundered Wisdom_, blackened crust comrades **RAMLORD** have focused on fine tuning their attack. They've embarked on an ongoing series of split releases (including last summer's crust-meets-USBM collision with Krieg), which have honed the trio into a truly formidable agent of sonic depravity. Flying solo this time out, the stenchcore irregulars unleash a desperate two-track flurry with appropriately bitter abandon on their new self-titled 7" single (out March 10th on Broken Limbs), a gut-level howl of bleakness and terminal despair.

Out prior to an upcoming US tour in May with THANTIFAXATH and IMPERIAL TRIUMPHANT, and a European leg in August with NUCLEAR DEVASTATION, this limited edition vinyl release keeps it sick-and-succinct on its two unflinching sides. "The Breached Sanctum" lurches from a deceptively placid intro to double-time crust-gallop to an anguished slow-motion climax with perilous, zombie-like precision and determination. The pace again picks up on the hardcore-indebted B-Side, "The Fog of Neglect," as shredded vocals barely balance on the back of a stubbornly unpredictable riff-beast.

Much more than a throwaway tour sweetener, this assertive 7" single gives RAMLORD a chance to once again completely own the spotlight (prior to dropping yet another split release). They take full advantage of the opportunity — as should fans. With a mere 300 copies up for grabs, this one is pretty well guaranteed to sell out quick.
