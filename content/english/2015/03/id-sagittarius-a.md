If this EP is anything to go by, a full-length album from **id.** will be an intriguing prospect. The band are indeed masters of their respective instruments and their song-writing is strong. Musically, they are very reminiscent of Opeth on ‘The Greatest Secret Never Told’. ‘Humanity’s Cry’ has a very quirky individual sound, and points well in the direction the band should go on a full-length. ‘id-entity’ is wild, like a cross between Mastodon and Opeth. The EP finishes with the title track ‘Sagittarius A’, which again shows the band developing their own unique identity.

I eagerly await the full album
