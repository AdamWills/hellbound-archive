The band whose 2014 release was named by Hellbound as [#1 album of the year](https://hellbound.ca/2014/12/hellbounds-best-2014-metal-albums-year-1-5/) is just about to head out on the road. **Pallbearer** kick off their spring 2015 tour March 20th in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and cross over into Canada (Vancouver) at the end of the month (March 30). After more American dates they cross the border again in April (April 8 in Toronto, ON at The Phoenix and April 9 in Montreal, QC at Metropolis) before heading to Europe in May. Most of the band's North American appearances see them featured as one of the opening acts for this year's spring Decibel Magazine Tour with At The Gates, Converge, and Vallenfyre.
