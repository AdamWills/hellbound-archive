**Kosmograd** is a four-piece band from Toronto, Ontario. Their sound consists of a variety of elements and influences from all over the music board. Orbiter, an EP released late in 2014, follows up their self-titled album from 2011. Being from Toronto Kosmograd has had the opportunity to open up for bands like Intronaut, The Atlas Moth and Solstafir. Now they are opening for [Yob and Enslaved as well, March 19](https://www.facebook.com/events/1521632384769343/)[th, 2015 at the Opera House](https://www.facebook.com/events/1521632384769343/).

This release contains three tracks and each of them has a vibe or feeling all its own. Judging by the sounds here, this group not only has a great ear and sense for their genre – that being post-metal or sludge; they have the ability to combine and create music that takes the listener on a journey. "Inconstant Moon" connects noise and effects with echoing notes that could be on par with anything bands like Isis or Pelican have done. The song later contains some sludgy doom riffs that have an epic feel and wouldn't be out of place on a Mastodon or Kylesa tune. By the end of the song the listener could say they have experienced a very progressive take on a beautiful stroll down the post-rock or metal lane.

The song "Orbiter" attacks the listener with some interesting post-metal riffage and contains harsh vocals reminiscent of early Isis and Cult of Luna. The track continues to progress with lots of pace changes with crashing drums and tremolo picked melodies but that’s not all the band offers. They also make a point to bring forth some emotion with these changes and then, to top it off, add some BM stylized vocals.

The final track "Laika" may be the most interesting of all. It’s not easy to combine elements for an assortment of great acts in any genre let alone this one but it happens here. Beautiful sounds, riffs and melodies emanate to a near perfect blending of Cave In, Pelican, Isis, Intronaut and Baroness. What really makes this work here is the addition of synths and a bass sound that a bands like Joy Division might have chosen. The guitar, bass, drums are bright spots here for sure but when hearing the changes in vocal styles from shouted clean to harsh it pushes this sound to the stars and back in terms of epicness.

One thing I will say is that this group sticks to their guns and doesn't get too spacey or left field but stays within the confines of this genre. Also that the small number of songs on this release may leave the post-metal or post-rock fan wanting more. But overall the recording sound does wonders here in establishing the convergence of sounds with clarity and power. This band does what a post-metal or modern sludge band should do, combining epic, emotional, heavy, and at times harsh music with a bright side, because like shadows it takes light to create them.
