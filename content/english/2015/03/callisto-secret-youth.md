Sincere and heartfelt, this is not an album for the casual listener; rather it is for the music lover who is prepared to give the music time to plant roots in the mind and appreciate all its nuances.

While **Callisto** are good song-writers, I found this album works best listened to as an organic whole. It is an emotive soundscape, taking the listener on an interior and exterior journey of highs and lows. There is also a welcome progressive element to their sound, Callisto are definitely not repeating themselves.

'Moving' sums it up best, a worthy addition for anyone who likes their music to have depth.
