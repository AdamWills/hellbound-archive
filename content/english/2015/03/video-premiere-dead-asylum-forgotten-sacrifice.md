Dead Asylum formed in Vancouver, BC at the end of 2011, featuring vocalist/guitarist **Mike Lister**, vocalist/guitarist **Tyler Forde**, bassist **Tyler Meierhofer** and drummer **Samantha Landa**. Dead Asylumâ€™s style spans the spectrum of metal--combining elements of thrash and death with melodic and grooving overtones--and echoes elements of band influences such as Kreator, Amon Amarth and Exodus.

"Forgotten Sacrifice" was filmed with Vancouver-based director Joshua Keith Young and intersperses performance footage along with a story line that tells the story of someone who is held captive, does their best to escape and, ultimately, gets their revenge after death.
