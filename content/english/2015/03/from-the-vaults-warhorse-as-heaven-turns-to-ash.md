I originally wrote this review for [Exclaim!](http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/warhorse-as_heaven_turns_to_ash) back in January of 2001 when this album was first released, but now that Southern Lord is reissuing it in a deluxe, remastered format with bonus tracks I thought it might be a good time to revisit this article.

Fourteen years on (!) I still think this album is a crushing death/doom masterpiece.

Warhorse _As Heaven Turns To Ash..._ By Sean Palmerston

After self-releasing an album and EP, Worchester, MA's Warhorse hit their stride this debut for new label Southern Lord. As with their like-minded brethren in Electric Wizard and Canada's own Sons of Otis, the band takes their power-trio formation and makes some of the heaviest, down-tuned doom ever captured to disc. The low end itself on the record is recorded immaculately and has already managed to wreck two sets of headphones, at a very low volume I might add. With former Infestation drummer Mike Hubbard leading the troops to battle, the trio travels from quiet introspective parts to crushing heaviness and back with such ease that it is a real delight to participate in the journey. The band is currently preparing to hit the road in North America with Electric Wizard, and judging from this disc, it may be the best underground tour of the year. (Southern Lord)
