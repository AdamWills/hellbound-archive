**GREBER**'s latest full-length, _Kiln Hardened Psalms_, came out late last year but the momentum is still building. The newest result? A video for one of the most ferocious tracks on a seriously (but not too serious) ferocious record.

Bassist Marc Bourgon took the time to answer a few questions:

**Why this song, "Fredericton"?**

Fredericton has been one of our favorites to play live for some time so it only made sense that we did it for the live style video. We don't play it live anymore sadly so we figured we'd immortalize it in VHS format.

**Where did the idea or inspiration from the video come from?**

Steve and I are pretty friggin' busy dudes. Between him being a new dad and doing his **Great Sabatini**/**Biipiigwan** bashing duties and myself with **Fuck the Facts** gearing up for our August 25th release of our new full-length, time is not something either of us has a lot of so the main focus for the video was doing something that would take us little to no time to plan, shoot and edit.

I had originally planned for this to be a rap style video where we were out in the woods and just looking mean as fuck with a weird background like the Beastie Boys "So Whatchya Want?" video. Turns out neither Steve nor I have the ability to look mean at all so we just decided to do what we do best. Look (key word here) like we are playing our song super awesome.

**Get into or encounter any mischief or shenanigans while making the video?**

None at all. My girlfriend Felicia shot it so I was on my best behavior the whole time. My boyfriend Dave from Dave Levitt Photography edited it after the fact. Huge thanks to both for your time!
