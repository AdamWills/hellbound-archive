Rise Above Records make an ideal home for **Galley Beggar**. They are not a metal band, but there is much here for any adventurously minded metal fan to love. To be honest, the Rise Above logo tells you all you need to know. For most people, one significant musical act in their life would be plenty. In label founder Lee Dorrian’s case, there are three: Napalm Death, Cathedral, and Rise Above Records. Look at the label's roster for proof: Witchcraft, Cathedral, Electric Wizard, Orange Goblin, Lucifer, The Oath, Death Penalty, Uncle Acid, and many more. Rise Above is always about the music.

Thus, it is so with the splendidly named Galley Beggars. Like Crumbling Ghost, this is British folk rock for the 21st century, and will appeal to anyone who likes the aforementioned band and the likes of Jethro Tull, Mellow Candle, Fairport Convention - and Opeth!

This is music from the heart, well played, beautifully sung, and very lifting, particularly on ‘Jack Orion’ and the title track.

Once again, Mr. Dorrian displays the taste typical of his vast musical knowledge. Wonderful work!
