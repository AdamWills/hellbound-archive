There is much speculation about what groove-metal band could fill the gap left by the sad demise of Pantera.

On the strength of the splendidly titled _Of Gods and Ghosts,_ **Kataklysm** could well be it. Good song-writing matched with top-notch playing prevails. Above all, there is muscle and melody, and that is what gives Kataklysm their edge.

Stirring stuff!
