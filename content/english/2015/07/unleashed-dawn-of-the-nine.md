As I write this review I am looking out over the mighty River Shannon where, centuries ago, the Vikings sailed their long ships to establish the still-thriving city of Limerick. As an Irishman, the Vikings are a big part of my cultural heritage and one I am very proud of. Vikings still strike a chord in people’s hearts. It is no coincidence that Valhalla plays such a big part in the culture of Immortan Joe’s warriors in ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’. In a very healthy piece of philosophy, the Vikings believed that one’s death was preordained by Odin, thus, there was no point in fear or worry, you would die at a certain time, and in the meantime, life was to be enjoyed. (Another fine piece of Viking philosophy was ‘Lift up the self by the self’. A very empowering idea that means you take care of yourself and take responsibility for your own actions, not relying on outside agencies, be they human or mystical). It is this Viking philosophy that gives **Unleashed**’s music extra weight and emotional depth.

As to the music on _Dawn of the Nine_, it is superb, very much a continuation of _Odalheim_. The playing is top class, and Johnny’s lyrics and vocals are very individual and distinct. This is very much a band in harmony, creating great work. All the tracks are outstanding - my personal favourite is "The Bolt Thrower".

Metal with power and passion!
