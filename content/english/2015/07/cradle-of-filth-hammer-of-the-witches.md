_Hammer of the Witches_ has the best **Cradle of Filth** cover since that of _Cruelty and the_  _Beast_, which featured the lovely Luisa Morando as Elizabeth Bathory (where is she  now?). The new artwork is very much in the vein (if you’ll pardon the pun!) of such Hammer Films classics like _Twins of Evil_ and _The Vampire Lovers_, splendid films all, everything just as it should be! Hammer Horror is a big part of what Cradle of Filth are, and indeed, they are a band that draw on a great many cultural references, all of which contributes to their own unique  identity. Calling the album _Hammer of the Witches_ is a good example, as a reference to Hammer Films. Hammer interestingly made a film called _The Witches_ an excellent tale of modern witchcraft, starring Joan Fontaine, and written by the great Nigel Kneale of _Quartermass_ fame. John Carpenter wrote the script of _Prince of Darkness_ under the pseudonym ‘Martin Quatermass’ in tribute to Kneale. Then there's also the vile witchhunter’s bible, the infamous _Hammer of the Witches_.

Musically, _Hammer of the Witches_ is superb. This is no surprise - Cradle of Filth have never made a bad album. Oh, it’s fashionable for the ‘culter than thou’ individuals who dictate what metal is good or not to deride Cradle of Filth, but the facts are this: Cradle of Filth are the most successful British metal band since the halcyon days of Iron Maiden, and deservedly do.

A superb album from a superb band. Buy it on vinyl - no download could do it justice!
