Can’t say I'm too familiar with **Opium Lord**, a UK sludge outfit, but they're coming to Toronto with Primitive Man on July 17, which is reason enough for me to check out their debut album here.

_The Calendrical Cycle: Eye of Earth_ opens right off the bat with the type of down-tuned riffage that instantly brings Noothgrush to mind, with some equally caustic vocal venom spewed overtop.  The band goes all low ‘n slow on “Pink Mass,” crawling along at a three-hundred-pound snail’s pace and crushing everything in its path.  “Crystals” is just as putrid and plodding as fellow blackened doomsters Primitive Man…which can be considered a compliment in this case. “Azazel” is about as blackened as the dark lord himself.

In any case, I certainly won’t be showing up late on Friday night.
