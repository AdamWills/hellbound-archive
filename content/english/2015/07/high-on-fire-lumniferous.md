Y’know, I kinda wish I hadn’t read [that interview with Matt Pike](http://www.theprp.com/2015/06/15/news/high-on-fires-matt-pike-im-not-a-conspiracy-theorist-im-a-conspiracy-factist/) where he says this album’s about saving The Illuminati from aliens before I heard _Lumniferous_. Evidently, the dude [dropped out of life with bong in hand](https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/10646749_1445837829068167_2888793671946635024_n.jpg?oh=32fde8caffc42faed804d2804907a16b&oe=562C501D) a long time ago. But **High on Fire**, they still bring it, maaaaaan...

This record comes growling out of the gate with “The Black Plot,” an upbeat piece of thrash sludge that wouldn’t sound outta place on _Blessed Black Wings_.  “Carcosa” is slightly sludgier, generally maintaining a faster tempo, but chucking in a whole buncha heavy breakdowns. Pike actually attempts to sing on “The Sunless Years,” which comes off more post-sludgy, sorta like pre-suck Mastodon before they go full-on thrash on the Goatwhorish “Slave the Hive.”

Those who are expecting more of the slower, heavier fare scattered across their last couple albums might be disappointed.  Meandering, mid-paced “The Falconist” comes close, but ultimately misses the mark.  “The Dark Side of the Compass” contains some of the heavy riffs one would expect, though it’s mostly a mid-paced chug-a-lugger.  “The Cave” has an unusual bluesy beginning, sounding somewhat like Down at their mellowest before it hits like a ton of bricks, the closest thing to a doom-metal power ballad you might hear this year.

Hold up yer lighters—Pikey needs another toke…
