If you haven't been fortunate enough to experience **Primordial** live, or if you have and just want to revisit the breautality of the band's live performance, Metal Blade appears to be looking out for you. This latest find comes courtesy of Hellbounder Danielle Griscti: "Pretty well shot, sound is good, and the rendition of 'Coffin Ships' is a perfect closer."

Primordial live at Cernunnos Festival in Paris, France (February 23rd, 2014). From the limited edition CD/DVD Digibook _Where Greater Men Have Fallen_.

**Track listing:**

01\. Journey's End (00:00) 02. Sons of the Morrigan (07:29) 03. The Coffin Ships (14:30)

We're a bit late for St. Paddy's day, but glittery green shamrocks don't really suit Primordial anyway...
