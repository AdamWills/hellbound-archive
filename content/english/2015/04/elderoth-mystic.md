**Elderoth** are the brainchild of a certain Collin McGee, and his singular vision has produced a unique metal sound. Many years ago, the great Ritchie Blackmore said a wise thing (this was around the time of the release of the ground-breaking _Rainbow Rising_ album): this was that so few guitarists had taken inspiration from Middle Eastern music, content instead to churn out the same chord progressions again and again.

With Elderoth, McGee has very much taken on this advice, producing music that is, heavy, mysterious and original. It also has to be said, it’s a very uplifting, song-orientated album, one that would go down like a storm in Europe!

McGee played, produced and wrote everything on this album, but I see there is now a live line-up so, as a constructive criticism, on the next release I feel the music would benefit more from their input, giving a warmer, live, sound.

But, otherwise, a sublime release!
