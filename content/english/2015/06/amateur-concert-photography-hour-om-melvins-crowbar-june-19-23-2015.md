I must admit, I'm not as big into NXNE as I used to be.  I just don't have the stamina anymore to stay up till 3 am 3-4 nights in a row, running from venue to venue in search of heavy music.  These days, I only do NXNE when there's someone I really wanna see...and this year, that band got denied at the border.  OK, so I figured that Pentagram gig was doomed from the start, but OM turned out to be a pretty decent consolation prize.  Even in less-than-ideal sound conditions (The Opera House makes me a sad panda), the duo of Al Cisneros and Emil Amos still sounds pretty tight, with added flourishes contributed by semi-official third member Robert Lowe...no, not [that one](http://www.getreadytorock.com/features/0906_srf_candlemass1.jpg).

Meanwhile, the Melvins show Monday at Danforth Music Hall showed what happens when you take a band out of the Opera House.  The past couple times they've played Toronto were at the east-end eyesore, but this time 'round, the clear, crisp sound of the Greektown theatre only served to accentuate a solid set by the veteran sludge stalwarts.  Bonus points for the art prints dissing Dave Grohl and that Kurt Cobain doc--I couldn't imagine putting them up on my wall, but they were good for a chuckle or two.

Speaking of sludge stalwarts...Crowbar was just here in October of last year, but I certainly didn't mind them making a return visit.  The band that made short-wearing group shots cool tends to keep it simple on stage, letting the riffs do the mourning.  And while I could hardly make out a word Kirk was saying--even when he was talking to the crowd--the man still brings it behind the mic.  You can almost taste his pain, washed down with a whole buncha Budweiser.
