I don’t often judge an album by its cover, but in the case of _A Feast of Virgin Souls_, I was more than a little put off by the artwork. It’s kinda like classic Cannibal Corpse, only slightly less gorey and much more misogynistic. And yet, one half of this female-fronted death/doom duo is… well, female. I guess **Wooden Stake** had it commissioned?

Anyhoo, the front cover isn’t the only thing that recalls Corpse, what with song-titles such as “Rise from the Bleeding Coffin,” “Dragged Through the Rotting Catacombs” and “Hanging from the Inverted Cross.” And yet, this isn’t paint-by-numbers, Cookie-Monster death metal, not by a long shot.

There are shades not only of trad doom, but even trad metal in “Rise from the Bleeding Coffin,” which contains clean vocals à la Blood Ceremony… with death growls thrown in for good measure, mind you. “Alzbeta: The Devil’s Bitch” is both the longest and doomiest tune on here, just under six minutes, dominated by death-metal vocals and coming off like a cross between Winter and Ides of Gemini. And while its title is seemingly pulled straight offa _Seven Churches_, “Exorcising the Possessed” serves up some melodious doom riffs that sound similar to Orodruin or Blizaro—the latter of whom they recorded a split with in 2011.

Surely enough, “Dragged Through the Rotten Catacombs” actually gives the impression of being pulled across putrid headstones with its knuckle-dragging doom, while “Hanging from the Inverted Cross” is equally despondent and slightly more Satanic. I actually liked this album a lot more than my first impression would suggest.
