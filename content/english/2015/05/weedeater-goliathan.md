I love seeing **Weedeater** live, but I wasn’t really a fan of their last album, which came out back in 2011. There were a couple too many goofy tracks on _Jason… the Dragon_, and other songs weren’t very long or particularly memorable. Put it this way, it was no _God Luck_ _and Good Speed_. But like I said, it’s been a while since that one.

_Goliathan_ is equally compact, with 10 tracks at a touch over 33 minutes. After church-organ intro “Processional” sets a bizarre stage, the title track kicks in with a sea of sludgy feedback, leading into a pretty decent doom riff. Dixie Dave’s infamous vocal venom rasps overtop the proceedings, setting a rather unpleasant tone—in a good way. Hey, we’re talking 'bout sludge here…

After a coupla solid-but-unspectacular head-nodders, Dixie breaks out the banjo on “Battered & Fried,” which is this album’s answer to “Palms and Opium.” And while I was intrigued by a tune called “Bully,” this one shuffles off in a hurry, fast-paced by Weedeater standards—it’s all over in less than two minutes. The slowed-down “Joseph (All Talk)” contains perhaps the best riff on the album; it’s slow, heavy, and simple, but it’ll get yer head noddin’. Y’know, kinda like Weedeater in general… I could probably do without the three-minute bass solo at the end of the album, though.
