I haven't been heading down to the States for shows very often since our dollar dropped far below par.  But I still had a few bucks lying around from my last U.S. trip, and with two of my favourite American doom bands playing within driving distance, I figured it was worth the effort.  I was pleasantly surprised by the reception at Flour City Station, a relatively new music venue in Rochester's East End.  I'd say the place is a giant leap up from customary local metal haunt The Bug Jar--and while I couldn't see the likes of Eyehategod playing there, it offered a solid setting for the evening's entertainment:

From the sounds of their set, you would've sworn local opener [Saints and Winos](https://www.facebook.com/SaintsAndWinos) were from Rochester, Maryland (which I don't think is an actual place).  Heavily influenced by Pentagram and The Obsessed, this heavy trio got the evening off to a solid, if somewhat belated, start.

Always a treat to see [Orodruin](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Orodruin/45193202799?sk=info&tab=page_info) live, especially since they hardly head up to Toronto anymore.  These original members of the Circle of True Doom (alongside Reverend Bizarre, The Gates of Slumber and a couple others) have hardly released anything since their celebrated split with the Bizarre Reverend over a decade ago, but their riffage remains timeless--and they continually deliver in the live setting.

[Apostle of Solitude](http://apostleofsolitude.com/) took the stage well past the witching hour--a time well-suited for their downtrodden, depressive doom.  Their set was culled mostly from latest album _[Of Woe and Wounds](https://hellbound.ca/2014/11/apostle-solitude-woe-wounds/)_, songs on which the dual vocal harmonies contributed by recently recruited guitarist Steve Janiak really add to the proceedings.  Would've liked to hear "[December Drives Me to Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeK-GOtrIQ)," but hey, tis the beginning of May, so I suppose we're well past that season at this point.
