Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. “Retro, throwback, '70s rock worshippers with occult-themed lyrics…” But wait, this isn’t just the same old song 'n dance. For one thing, this Virginia outfit isn’t female-fronted, nor are they merely Electric Wizard clones… although they did open for the Wizard on its North American tour.

Rather, this evil trio’s influences run the gamut from Rush s/t to Pentagram. They covered UFO last time I saw ‘em—and no, it wasn’t “Doctor, Doctor, either—and once did a whole set worth of Blue Cheer tunes at Roadburn. So **Satan's Satyrs** ain’t just apin’ Aerosmith and the Stones… at all, really.

_Don’t Deliver Us_, already their third record, opens on an eerie note, with Pentagram-style riffs accented by some Grand Funk boogie-woogie piano. It ain’t typical, but it works. “Two Hands” is more of an up-tempo chugger until it hits you with several doomy breakdowns interspersed throughout. And man, I gotta say it, their singer’s a dead ringer for Mike Dean… which certainly isn’t everybody’s cup of conformity.

“(Won’t You Be My) Gravedancer” wins the prize for spookiest song title, also offering a heavy helping of Liebling-infused retro doom in the process. “Germanium Bomb” is about as impactful as its moniker implies, a bass-heavy thrasher that sounds like The Sweet on meth. “Creepy Teens” might be more like The Misfits, if they were from San Fran and fronted by [Mary Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOcnlCgZdL4). And played extended guitar solos, too.

So yes, this outfit is certainly set on bringing the '70s back, but unlike some of those sitar-picking, bell-bottomed douchebags, they certainly don’t suck!
