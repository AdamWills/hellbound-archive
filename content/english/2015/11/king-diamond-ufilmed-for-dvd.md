"Philadelphia and Detroit have been selected as the cities in which [KING DIAMOND](https://hellbound.ca/?s=king+diamond) will film the live shows for the forthcoming DVD", reads the announcement that made my eyes bug out a little upon reading it.  Playing with special guests EXODUS, the shows being filmed are on Wednesday November 25th in Philadelphia and Saturday the 28th in Detroit.

"The massive, multi-camera shoot will be directed by Denise Korycki (Cannibal Corpse, Killswitch Engage) and will also include additional footage from multiple shows throughout the entire 'Abigail in Concert 2015' tour." - continues the announcement.  You can read the full public release on their website [here](http://www.kingdiamondcoven.com/site/featured/king-diamond-invites-fans-to-be-a-part-of-heavy-metal-history/).

Sure to be a couple of stellar performances of a veritable classic of an album, Abigail.  Tickets are still available for [Philadelphia](http://concerts.livenation.com/event/02004EFCE6B4AB75) ($39.50+) and [Detroit](http://concerts.livenation.com/event/08004EFEF29F5751) ($25+) through Live Nation.
