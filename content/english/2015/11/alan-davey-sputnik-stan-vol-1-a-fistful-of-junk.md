Alan Davey is a legend on the British underground music scene. For many years he was bassist/vocalist for British space rock legends **Hawkwind**. Seeing Alan play live with Hawkwind is still one of the best gigs I’ve ever seen. Indeed, in a great many ways, he is a worthy heir to his predecessor in Hawkwind, Lemmy: Bass Assassins Numbers One and Two respectively (an honour bestowed on Alan by Lemmy himself!).

Alan eventually left Hawkwind, leaving the band much poorer for his absence. Since then Alan has played with such bands as The Meads of Asphodel, The Wolves of Avalon, Gunslinger and Bedouin.

_Sputnik Stan Vol 1_ is up to Alan’s usual high standards, something of a space metal concept album in the vein of Hawkwind, with the groove of Motorhead. The songs, playing and production are first class.

Moreover, this a very uplifting album, one I highly recommend.

(Earthquake Records)
