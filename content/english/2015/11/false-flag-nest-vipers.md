**False Flag**'s _Nest of Vipers_ is an excellent EP that doesn’t outstay it’s welcome. Four tracks of prime groove metal. Reference points are Lamb of God, Exhorder, and of course, Pantera. What gives this its own identity is the level of musical virtuosity of the band members. There is also a genuine band dynamic and sincerity there.

Here and there some surprisingly progressive influences rear their heads, and the song-writing is strong.

Overall, a band to watch out for in the future.
