Hailing from Montreal, and going since 2007, **Evertrapped** have a lot of experience under their collective belts and it shows.

Production-wise, this album is flawless, every instrument being heard with complete clarity. Soundwise, for the benefit of the readers I’d say we’re talking a combination of At The Gates and Unearth, but that doesn’t do justice to the band’s own originality. Every song is infused with melody, the guitar work is truly epic and imaginative; time-changes abound. In other words, it's sincere music, played from the heart. It has a certain epic sweep to it that I like.

Lyrically, the silly themes that often infest metal are absent, and the lyrics on _Under the Deep_ are more in line with Metallica circa _…And Justice For All_, observations of the world around us, speculations on where events in the world will lead humanity, and so forth.

Overall, a superb record from a band that deserves a much higher profile.
