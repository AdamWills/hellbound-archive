Y'know, I can't even remember the last time I celebrated Halloween or Samhain or whatever (unless listening to Danzig counts), but stick two stoner/doom luminaries on stage on a Sunday night in November, and that'll get me up off my ass faster than you can say "Too much bass, Batman!"

Last time I saw OTIS was at this very same venue, [opening for Ufomammut in May](https://hellbound.ca/2015/05/amateur-concert-photography-hour-ufomammutsons-of-otisusnea-mod-club-may-16-2015/). The Mod Club is a more-than-adequate environment for said outfit, offering ample stage room, a solid sound system, and a projector screen, allowing them to magnify their lava lamp like so:

YOB's second trip to Toronto in 2015 sure sounded superior to the first. I caught 'em in March when they opened for Enslaved at the Opera House, and while the effort was certainly there, they sorta sounded like a wet fart coming outta the Queen St E hall's shitty speakers. Twas certainly not the case on this occasion, as the band delivered a crushing, punishing set unencumbered by PA problems. Picture being punched in the gut by a two-ton bulldozer--that's more or less how I felt afterwards.
