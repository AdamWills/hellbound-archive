Y’know, I was kinda wondering what had happened to these guys; it had been over four years since the release of their last record, _Death’s Procession_, and subsequent tour supporting Weedeater. No longer signed to Kemado Records, which seems to have fallen off the face of the earth itself, this Oakland retro-rock outfit is still nevertheless intact.

_Palace of Vision_ starts off on “The Mountain,” whose uptempo, sludgy, yet melodic riffage comes off as a cross between former labelmates The Sword and fellow Smokelanders High on Fire. “Flesh of Fire” slows things down considerably, although its not all doom ‘n gloom, with some rather bright-sounding guitar interludes breaking up pretty punishing verses.

The sludge-punk returns with “Devil’s Crown,” which even adds a dash of Lemmy to the proceedings. From there it’s back to the straight-up sludge, with the title track a rather doomy romp, once again reminiscent of Matt Pike and co. Hell, I ever hear a bit of “For Whom the Bell Tolls” in the verse structure.

For the most part, the rest of the record fits the Oakland sound that bands like HOF and **Saviours** have established. Always good to hear it again!
