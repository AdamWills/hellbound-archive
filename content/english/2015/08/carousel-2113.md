I’m not really a Rush fan, but I gotta say, it takes some giant gonads to effectively name your album 2112 + 1.  Then again, the official explanation from these Pittsburgh rockers is that _2113_ is actually their house number.  And hey, **Carousel** don’t sound much like Rush, anyways… unless you go all the way back to 1974.

That’s right, this outfit plays 70’s style riff-rock that sounds right at home on Tee Pee Records—this is, in fact, their second release for the label. Of note, lead axeman Matt Goldsborough has been a hired hand for both The Skull and Pentagram, which explains why the album opens with a tune called “Trouble” and ends with “Turn to Stone,” although neither is particularly doomy. Elsewhere, “Photograph” contains more wah than an Electric Magma jam sesh, while “Jim’s Song” sounds like a cross between Fu Manchu and Mothership and “Highway Strut” brings Vancouver retro rockers La Chinga to mind.

Although “2113” is nearly eight minutes long, it’s actually a drawn-out, bluesy number somewhat akin to AC/DC’s “Night Prowler,” albeit with a more upbeat chorus complete with dual British metal leads.  And sure enough, it seems to be about a shithole. No priests anywhere near here. Hell, the midway interlude reminds me more of Triumph…
