**[![JulianCopeCopendium](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/JulianCopeCopendium-150x150.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/JulianCopeCopendium.jpg)Things I recommend as you settle into autumn and then winter’s embrace.** Re-watch _Fringe_ all over again: it’s been a marvellous winter treat to tuck into. Sit down to some weird and wonderful UK comedy from recent years, including shows like _The Mighty Boosh_, Garth Marenghi’s _Darkplace_, _Man to Man with Dean Learner_, and _The League of Gentlemen_. Read, _The KLF: Chaos, Magic and the Band that Burned a Million Pounds_, by John Higgs. Superb music writing. An incredibly oddball tale. And the books is packed with arcane knowledge and genuinely eccentric characters. Read, _The Humans_ (comic). Recommended to me by Hellbound alumnus Kyle Antivenin, and an absolute turbo-charged blast of simian pandemonium. Read, Julian Cope’s _Copendium_. Some of the most madcap music writing ever published. I wish I could write like the Arch Druid Cope. His often surreal musings on music, life, history and art are well worth repeated reading.

[![noisem](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/noisem-150x150.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/noisem.jpg)1\. Noisem - Blossoming Decay (A389): These young lads are great motivation for endless lawn maintenance. [a389recordings.bandcamp.com/album/blossoming-decay](http://a389recordings.bandcamp.com/album/blossoming-decay) 2. Second Sun - Hopp/Fortvivlan (Electric Assault): The lyrics are in Swedish but the tunes are sweet. Retro rock gold. [electricassaultrecords.bandcamp.com/album/hopp-f-rtvivlan](http://electricassaultrecords.bandcamp.com/album/hopp-f-rtvivlan) 3. Dope Smoker - III, and Volume 4 (self): No explanation necessary. [dopesmoker.bandcamp.com/album/dope-smoker-vol-4](http://dopesmoker.bandcamp.com/album/dope-smoker-vol-4) 4. Immortal Bird - Empress/Abscess (Broken Limbs/Manatee Rampage): Totally vicious. Gets the blood pumpin' better than coffee. But coffee is good too. [immortalbird.bandcamp.com/album/empress-abscess](http://immortalbird.bandcamp.com/album/empress-abscess) 5. Sons of Huns - While Sleeping Stay Awake (RidingEasy): Garage/stoner rock with members of Danava. Amazing, amazing stuff. [sonsofhuns.com/album/while-sleeping-stay-awake](http://sonsofhuns.com/album/while-sleeping-stay-awake)

**Anticipating:** CLUTCH!!!!!!!!! Still working my way through the _Amtrak Wars_ by Patrick Tilley. I'm on Book 5: _Death-Bringer_.

#### Gabe Hugh

[![Kyuss_Welcome_to_Sky_Valley](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Kyuss_Welcome_to_Sky_Valley-150x150.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Kyuss_Welcome_to_Sky_Valley.jpg)1\. Welcome to Sky Valley - Kyuss. Delivers the smoking hot, grooviest riffs this side of any Desert and will keep your head nodding while cruising with the top down. 2. White Pony - Deftones. The cure to your end of summer blues, these Kings of Pain bringer the listener so much solace it's hard to tell why they were heartbroken in the the first place 3. Valley of Smoke - Intronaut. This progressive album is a grower that blends stoner, jazz and technical sounds to keep you chilling on the beach, water or patio for endless hours while enjoying your favourite vice of choice; it is also the perfect soundtrack to summer star gazing! 4. Success - Ken Mode. Looking for a party and rock out album for your backyard BBQ or patio bash look no further. Combining noise, indie and punk for a mix that will have friends bouncing and moving to the catchiness it displays – let's just hope no one gets hurt stagediving off your roof jumping into the pool or lake! 5. Hvis lyset tar oss - Burzum. If it's too hot for you this summer you can always throw on some Black metal and hope that the tones bring you down to those cold, chilling, bleak and dark feelings that some of us feeling during the Canadian Winter.

[![MyDyingBride](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MyDyingBride-150x150.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MyDyingBride.jpg)I've been on a massive My Dying Bride kick ever since I seen them at MDF last year... Honestly their whole discog has been on my weekly playlist on headphones, in the car, etc. Most played band ever.

Other notables have been the new Paradise Lost and Gruesome LPs.

Most anticipated is, of course... the new My Dying Bride LP (which I have preordered on LP and CD) and the new Hooded Menace (which I plan on getting in all 3 LP colours).

**[![AncientMoon](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AncientMoon-150x150.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AncientMoon.jpg)My top 5 for this summer is:** 1. Ancient Moon - Vvltvre 2. Kommandant - The Architects of Extermination 3. Failure - The Heart is a Monster 4. Goat Torment - Sermons to Death 5. Sweat Lodge - Talismana

For fall I am definitely looking forward to the new Revenge album. That is my most anticipated release at the moment.

As for a movie recommendation, I'd have to go with _The End of the Tour_. It's a movie that's based on a true story, includes journalism and partially takes place where I live!

#### Sean Palmerston

[![Van_Halen_album](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Van_Halen_album-150x150.jpg)](https://hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Van_Halen_album.jpg)Van Halen - I (Warner Bros) Iron Maiden - Killers (Harvest/EMI) Motorhead - Ace of Spades (Bronze/Polygram) Indesinence - III (Profound Lore) King's X - Faith Hope Love (Megaforce)

Cattle Decapitation - The Anthropocene Extinction (Metal Blade) 2. Royal Thunder - Crooked Doors (Relapse) 3. Imperial Triumphant - Abyssal Gods (Code 666) 4. Dead Quiet - Dead Quiet (Self Released) 5. Graveyard - Innocence & Decadence (Nuclear Blast)

Considering my list, it's no surprise that I'm most looking forward to checking out the Cattle Decapitation show in Toronto next month. Having Black Crown Initiate and Dark Sermon as openers is just icing on the cake.
