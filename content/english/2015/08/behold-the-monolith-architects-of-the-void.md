**Behold** one of the few (if not the only one I can think of) “noun the verb” bands that _doesn’t_ play metalcore. Instead, **The Monolith** deals in stoner/sludge stuff somewhat akin to High on Fire and/or Lord Dying, with song titles (and artwork) that would give The Sword’s J.D. Cronise a hard-on. Actually, not gonna lie, the album cover of this record is pretty badass…

_Architects_ begins on a slow note with “Umbral Vale” giving off more of a Neurosis, post-sludge vibe… aside from the blackened, bleakened vocals more akin to death-doom. “Philosopher’s Blade” sounds more like Pike and company, especially once they pick up the tempo, first to more of a mid-paced march, and eventually to a full-on black/thrash attack.

Likewise, black metal abounds on “The Midthriditist,” which also contains slow, forlorn passages that wouldn’t sound outta place on _Souls at Zero_, while the heavy sludge of “Lord of Bones” reminds me of Noothgrush. You’d almost swear these guys were from Oakland, not Los Angeles!
