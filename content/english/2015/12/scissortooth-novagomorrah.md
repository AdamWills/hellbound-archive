Excellent power-trio. Musically, they are superb, playing as a three-headed hydra, each seemingly anticipating what the other is going to play, and locking seamlessly together.

Song-writing is top notch; if this album had been released back when people bought their music rather than stole it, this would be a massive seller.

Overall, I feel the thing that gives the excellently-named **Scissortooth** an edge over so many of the cookie cutter bands out there clogging the scene is that their own original voice is mixed with some very diverse influences indeed.

A superb and original band!
