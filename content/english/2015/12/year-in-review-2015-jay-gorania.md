As another year draws to a close, we metalheads tend to take time to reflect on what the year in metal meant to us, and prepare our various lists of what was great, what sucked, and everything in between.

This year we decided to get a little more up close and personal with Team Hellbound, and get a sense of not only each staffer’s favorite albums of the year, but also a sense of the state of metal in 2015 from everyone.

We here at Hellbound thank you for your continued readership, and wish you a very headbanging 2016.

_Happy Holidays from Hellbound!_

**My 2015 in Metal**

I recently crawled out of a miserable hole of depression, so life itself was a breath of fresh air, and metal was, as always, the greatest soundtrack to provide the backdrop to daily successes and smiles, failures and tears.
