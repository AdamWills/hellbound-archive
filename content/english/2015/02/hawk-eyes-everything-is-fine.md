I’ve reviewed a lot of albums in my time, and inevitably so many of them have to include lines like ‘sounds like such and such a band’; it’s inevitable.

But in the case of **Hawk Eyes**, I’m happy to report they sound like themselves, which is as it should be.

Musically, the band are adroit, well able to play, but never over-egging the pudding, always serving their songs.

And this is Hawk Eyes’ greatest strength, they’ve written really good songs, not just a collection of riffs with someone screaming over them. A riff on its own is not a song – it needs words, melodies and feeling, and they have this in spades.

A band to watch out for in the future.
