Once upon a time, metal was actually fun, no really. And the splendidly named **Them County Bastardz** harken back to that era.

What you got here are some seriously well-written riff-based tracks (crushing riffs, real' wall of sound' stuff) in the vein of Black Label Society and Pantera circa _Cowboys From Hell_. There’s also something of Alice In Chains in there too. Good influences, but Them County Bastardz have a strong personality all of their own. Overall, it’s like some crazy concept album. I kept thinking of _Smokey and the Bandit_ as I listened to it. Indeed, it’s feel good stuff all the way, a great joke at the expense of the dire band Extreme (never was a band more badly named! Pathetic would have been a more apt moniker).

The production, by the band and a certain Chris Towle, is first class.

As a constructive suggestion, not a criticism, I detect an AC/DC influence, and I’d like to hear them do more of this in future.

Overall, a damn fine album!
