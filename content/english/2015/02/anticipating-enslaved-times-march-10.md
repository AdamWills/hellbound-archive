Available on March 10th 2015 in North America, from the folks over at Nuclear Blast, it's **ENSLAVED** with _In Times._ So far only an edited version of one track has been released. These guys know very well their fans will still bite though – with a discography like theirs, one doesn't really need to hesitate too much about it.

Even as I tried to jot down notes for this it was tough to stay still enough to do it. This preview track is so good, so wonderfully headbang-worthy, I find it tough to pull away from. Enslaved once again remind us of their incredibly versatile use of vocal styles,\* starting off with a delicious raspy growl sure to please fans of their earlier material, before delivering the piercingly clear, warm, clean hooks. I can't help but be reminded of Mikael Åkerfeldt (Opeth) as those perfect vocals float overtop the lead-guitar work of Ice Dale threading the line between genres and worlds, as Enslaved have been doing over the course of their last few full-lengths in a wonderful evolution.
