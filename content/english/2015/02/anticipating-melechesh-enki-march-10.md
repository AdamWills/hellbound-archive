Available on March 10th 2015 in North America, from the folks over at Nuclear Blast, it's **MELECHESH** with _Enki_. Promising to add yet another solid full length to their just about flawless repertoire, MELECHESH are set for a European tour to perform tasty new tracks like "Multiple Truths" (lyric video below).

MELECHESH accompanied by a veritable horde of guests, including Max Cavalera (Sepultura, Cavalera Conspiracy) and Sakis Tolis (Rotting Christ) — I'm sure I'm not the only fan going nuts with eager anticipation to hear how the whole album pans out. For the moment though, enjoy another sample of their elaborately flavoured, melodic black metal. The aforementioned Max pops in cheekily here on "Lost Tribes":
