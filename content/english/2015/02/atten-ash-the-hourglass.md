Three-piece NC atmospheric death doom combo **ATTEN ASH** bear deep roots in the scene, despite only becoming an entity in 2011; Barre Gambling & Archie Hunt cut their teeth in heavyweight acts **DAYLIGHT DIES** and **LEGION OF THE FALLEN** before joining forces with founder James Greene. This collective muscle memory helped to carry an already fully realized vision from the start, with their formative period dedicated to crafting a formidable collection of songs. Recorded and released digitally in 2012 to relative obscurity at the time, **ATTEN ASH**’s 1st full length, _Hourglass_ is now finally getting a proper physical release three years later as a 4 panel digipack CD through Saskatoon-based independent non-profit record label and webshop Hypnotic Dirge Records.

Much like iconic Peaceville act **KATATONIA**, **ATTEN ASH** lace aggressive melancholy with a bitter pop sensibility on _Hourglass_. Standout tracks like opener ‘City on the Sea’ and ‘Not as Others Were’ bind harsh death vox with pristine harmonies and dynamic arrangements. **ATTEN ASH** seamlessly weave this surprisingly vibrant blend of murky crunch and melodicism into a majestic sonic tapestry throughout.

With this regal edict of icy inevitability, **ATTEN ASH** has firmly secured its rightful place alongside **OCTOBER TIDE**, **DOOM:VS** and other demigods in the upper reaches of the unholy death doom pantheon. _Hourglass_ marks the advent of an especially fearsome vessel of ominous ruination. Take great heed.
