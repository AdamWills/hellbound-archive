**By Kyle Harcott**

Melbourne’s **Thrall** returns with their fourth full-length, _Schisms_, after a nearly seven-year hiatus from recording. Their last full-length, _Aokigahara Jukai_, was this writer’s favourite album of 2013. A lot has changed in that time. The band’s lineup continues to revolve around Tom Void, and Thrall still sounds like some kind of demonic wind-tunnel vortex of blackened thrash, I’m happy to report.

A snarling, whirling amalgam of chaos blackmetal, Thrall continues to mesmerize invoking elements of doom, thrash, and even post-rock at times, and fear not – the OUGH! factor remains high.

But, while despair is a component at the heart of _Schisms_, and the lyric content remains suitably nihilistic – I dare say, to this writer’s ears – I hear an element of hope buried in the mix there as well. It’s hard to explain; this is, after all, black metal; you’re meant to leave any sentiment of goodwill or life - affirmation at the door, abandoning all H-word who enter here. But there’s something in the riffs that come across triumphant and offering strength. Even though Thrall has always been masterful at illustrating what a plague humanity is, going back to their first album, and that’s no different on _Schisms_, I cannot help but find myself breathing a sigh of relief. Humanity’s fucked, and a plague upon the earth – but hey, at least we’re all on this sinking, burning ship together.

The title track kicks us off with a bang; a relentless crushing blast that mesmerizes into a blackened roil, in the midst of its hellish chorus. But it’s the head-caving onslaught of those blasting verses that jump out at me, and right down my throat. Stellar lead guitar work as well.

“Tyrant” meanwhile, storms out of gate like sheet-lightning season with an attack worthy of classic Immortal – invoking deepest winter with freezing-cold, right-angled lead riffs that feel like ice daggers aimed at your heart.

“Veils” is pure triumph, summoning thousandfold vitriol and martial riffs that definitely call up latter-day Darkthrone in all the best ways possible. While “Hollow”, with its lyrics painting the fall of religion and eventual returning to dust, swirls and heaves like a dark forest dirt road driven at breakneck speed, with momentary interludes to give you that false bit of security.

There’s something sublime in the poetry of “Nihil”, a lyrical paean to time, suffering, and ultimately, the same death that none escape. The guitars course slow like freezing syrup, like some kind of stringed march unto death – there can only be one ultimate end.

The straight-up rock riffing in the beginning of “Abyss” is a clever deception before the song summarily marches you off a cliff. While “Epoch” is just that – epochal and apocalyptic, illustrating the violent death throes of a world driven to its doom by one parasitic species.

Finally, we’re left with “Dust”. Epic in its sprawling scope and running the gamut of styles in a kitchen-sink mix of riff violence and deceptively hard-rocking… well, “rocking” – the song is the ultimate fitting ending to an album celebrating the vaunted end of mankind’s reign.

Thrall’s masterful return with the vicious nihilist prayer of _Schisms_ is much welcome, especially in a world where it’s never felt closer to the end. Come, headbang, celebrate as Rome burns.
