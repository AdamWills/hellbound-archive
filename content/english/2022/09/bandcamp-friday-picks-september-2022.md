Today - it's time again for [Bandcamp Friday](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays-update), where the folks over at Bandcamp completely waive their revenue share in order to offer more support directly to the artists.

More info is on the Bandcamp [blog](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser).  Here are a couple of picks to guide you in navigating the huge catalogue that's available:

"_Since birth, ORANSSI PAZUZU, 'The Demon Of The Wind With The Colour Of Cosmic Energy,' has never been satisfied to stick with a formula. Each album has seen the band expand upon its previous incarnation and then, like a supernova, blow it up and transform again into something recognizable but completely new."_
