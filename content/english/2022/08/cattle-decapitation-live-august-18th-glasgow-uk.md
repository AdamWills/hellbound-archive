Hot off the trail of their debut appearance at **Bloodstock Festival**, American death/grinders **Cattle Decapitation** are back in Glasgow. In 2019, they released their prescient album _Death_ _Atlas_ and toured for it into the following year, before cancellations due to you-know-what. So this delayed European tour promotes that album and feels timely considering the global depression underway now.

**The Cathouse** is nicely busy tonight, and the anticipation is at lofty heights as intro _Anthropogenic: End Transmission_ crawls through the venue. The band explodes on stage with _The Genocide,_ a whole paroxysm of scathing and foreboding death metal. Frontman **Travis Ryan** employs his guttural death metal growls and cleaner anguished snarls to significant effect. Melody-tinged solos from **Josh Elmore** provide some respite from the barrage of **David McGraw’s** blastbeats and frenetic tremolo picking.

There’s barely time to breathe as the extreme metallers hurl themselves straight into _Vulture_ with its mid-paced bludgeoning tempos introduction. This segues into the comparatively melodic and pandemic-themed _Bring Back the Plague_. The music video for this gained some celebrity by being made during the first lockdown, featuring scenes of the band’s members each in their homes interspersed with shots of early pandemic insanity (e.g. toilet paper hoarding). The only songs from earlier in their blood-drenched catalogue are modern favourites _Forced Gender_ _Reassignment_ and _Plagueborne._ The sound is as courteous as a venue like this can be for death metal. You can attest that the fans are ecstatic by surveying the constant mosh pit and haphazard crowd surfers.

Unsurprisingly, the last track of the night is the title track _Death Atlas,_ running just shy of ten minutes. This is the closest to epic **Cattle Decapitation** gets, mired in frustration, hopelessness and sheer misanthropy… perfectly summing up the themes of the world right now. Considering the dystopia we’re ostensibly in these days, **Cattle Decapitation** are truly the soundtrack of today. But then again, they’ve been warning us about these days for a couple of decades now.
