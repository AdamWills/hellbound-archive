Sunday night - what better time for an evening of thinking man’s chaotic avant-garde black metal, namely **Imperial Triumphant** from New York. This show was another covid casaulty, originally penned in for last year but was inevitably postponed. Formed in 2005 by **Zachary** **Ilya Ezrin**, they released a few full-lengths but it was 2008’s _Vile Luxury_ that catapulted them to the forefront of the extreme metal underground.

Bedecked in an emotionless classical art style, golden masks and black cowls, **Imperial** **Triumphant** grace the stage. They waste no time with introductions as they brute-force their show with the eight-minute T_ower of Glory, City of Shame_. With **Ezrin’s** guitar and **Steve** **Blanco’s** basslines of off-beat psychosis and schizophrenic passages, this should be a cavernously unnerving experience. Unfortunately, the sound is awkwardly hampered; **Kenny** **Grohowski’s** drums overpower all the other instruments, vocals and harrowing orchestration, leaving the music threadbare.

Keeping to the new album _Spirit of Ecstacy_, the three-piece immediately launches into _Merkurius Gilded,_ full of nasty but almost melodic tremolo picking and flattening tones. The contrasting barbershop quartet sample, signals for a trip to 2020’s album _Alphaville_ with the sinister _Atomic Age,_ featuring an abundance of technical, prog and jazz trimmings, occasionally reducing the heaviness and tempo to harness a more subtly sinister mood. _Transmission to Mercury_ from the same album follows, and by now the sound has mainly improved, but still loses a lot of its dense atmosphere. It’s hard to do justice to this kind of music in the live sphere.

Bassist **Blanco** offers forth an unusual bass solo, something rarely witnessed at black metal shows. Despite their unorthodox nature, the band’s stage presence resembles that focused ritual that other modern black metal acts have become adept at creating: mysterious, austere and wordless. It 100% works for **Imperial Triumphant**, perhaps more so than others. After new song _Maximalist Scream_ ravages the audience, the Americans march off. The crowd remains in place as they demand for more madcap avant-garde metal. The trio returns to satiate appetites with a final one-two strike of  _Swarming Opulence_ and _Rotted_ _Futures._

There’s a lot of adjectives you can employ to describe **Imperial Triumphant’s** cacophony: sociopathic, nightmarish, rotten, majestic, astral, labyrinthine, torturous, neurotic, virtriolic…the list is endless. Such original multi-layered and technical music is a delight to behold live. Sadly, sound engineers and venues are likely to conspire against these sounds because they’re so rare. Still, **Imperial Triumphant’s** stage presence and performance marks this a highlight for the week.
