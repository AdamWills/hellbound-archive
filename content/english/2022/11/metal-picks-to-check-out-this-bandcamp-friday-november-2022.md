Hello again, it's another "[Bandcamp Friday](https://isitbandcampfriday.com/)" out there - more details on this recurring series are on the Bandcamp [blog](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays-update).

Anyway, once again here's a humble offering of some picks that I, your resident psychedelic black metal/sci-fi loving weirdo, particularly enjoyed since last month.  That should give you a good idea of what you're in for if you dive in here - highlights abound, get ready for lots of unforgettable riffs, some face-melting solos and plenty of downright spooky atmospheres.
