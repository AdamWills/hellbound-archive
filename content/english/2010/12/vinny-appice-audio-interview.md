Hellbound.ca's Jason Wellwood recently had the opportunity to speak to **HEAVEN & HELL/DIO/BLACK SABBATH** sticksman **Vinny Appice** about a number of different topics. The chance to interview Vinny was proposed due to the recent releases of both the **HEAVEN & HELL** _Neon Nights_ live DVD and CD releases, and also because of the recently released **DIO** double CD _Dio At Donington: 1983 & 1987_**.** Mr. Appice was, as you will find out, a true gentleman and a pleasure for Jason to interview. They discuss the passing of Dio, his thoughts on the _Neon Nights_ DVD, what the future holds for Heaven & Hell, the drum kit he used on the final H&H tour and his current musical plans.

This interview was originally done for Mr. Wellwood’s radio show “Blowing Up The Lakehead”, which airs each and every Monday night on [CILU FM](http://luradio.ca/wp/) in Thunder Bay. If you ever get the chance, check out his show online because it is great and he does it all for the love of metal!

Visit us later this week when we publish Jason's recent interview with one-time DIO guitarist **Craig Goldy** about the recent _Dio At Donington: 1983 & 1987_ collection.
