You may remember that about a month ago Hellbound published an interview that **Jason Wellwood** did with the one and only [**Phil Anselmo**](http://www.hellbound.ca/2010/11/phil-anselmo-the-hellbound-interview/). This interview was originally done for Mr. Wellwood's radio show "Blowing Up The Lakehead", which airs each and every Monday night on [CILU FM](http://luradio.ca/wp/) in Thunder Bay.Â  Since it was so successful on the site - it is now our number two most read article of all-time - we jumped at the chance to also put up the audio files of the entire interview when Mr Wellwood offered.

So, as promised, here is the entire audio interview broken down into three parts for your listening pleasure
