Tonight was a night of reunions, or so it would seem. Sean was out getting down with his longtime Hamilton homies, Chore, during their reunion weekend shows. Albert was shaking his Southern Rock money-maker to Blackfoot (though, it’s debateable whether Blackfoot ever really went away long enough to have anything post-1985 considered a reunion). Me? It was a reunion that had me, myself and I guiding the good ship/leaky rowboat that is Hellbound Radio by my lonesome. Nothing really to report, as anything I had to say, I probably said it on air and how much do you really think happens in a deserted college campus radio station on a Sunday night anyway?

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at [www.indifm.ca](http://www.indifm.ca). Wanna request something or give us shit? (905) 575-2101.

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
