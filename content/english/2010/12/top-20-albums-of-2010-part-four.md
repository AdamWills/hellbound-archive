Ladies and gentleman, the **TOP 5 METAL ALBUMS OF 2010** according to the contributing writers of Hellbound.ca...

## 5\. KYLESA - _Spiral Shadow_

### (Season Of Mist)

![](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/5.jpg "5")With its razor-sharp hooks, wild card "Don’t Look Back" threw a lot of people for a loop this year. But the real magic of _Spiral Shadow_ is **Kylesa** continuing to improve upon what they do best: Ever-evolving their songwriting by juxtaposing the band’s love of/influence from swirly psych-rock with hammer-and-tongs, earthy sludge bombast. From the opening good-trip-gone-bad-gone-good-again of “Tired Climb”, through the claustrophobic resignation of “Drop Out", right up to the closing, pensive, almost-as-hooky-as-DLB recline of “Dust”, _Spiral Shadow_ is an immense rollercoaster through the band’s collective psyche, and shows them once again setting the bar higher than they had for 2009’s _Static Tensions_; again, as with the last album, I’m rapt with anticipation to see where they’ll possibly take it next. **Kyle Harcott**

## 4\. ANATHEMA - _We're Here Because We're Here_

### (Kscope)

![](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/04.jpg "04")I prefer not to listen to individual tracks from a record – especially by one of my favourite bands ­– before I have the full album in hand. _We’re Here Because We’re Here_ was many years in the making, so it was listen in pieces as they slowly emerged or musically starve. Hearing the whole for the first time, I found its complex beauty unfolding, not as a revelation, but as the voice of a well-loved friend. Its layered complexity ebbs and swells like a tide, not with the harsh weight of metal but with a rising intensity that demonstrates Anathema’s mastery of extremes. I can still hear the band that was (though more _Eternity_ than _Serenades_) but as a faint whisper amidst a richly textured ocean of sound. **Laura Wiebe**

## 3\. TRIPTYKON - _Eparistera Daimones_

### (Century Media)

![](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/03.jpg "03") **Celtic Frost** reunited and toured then quickly broke up, leaving the loyal with just a tantalizing taste of one of metal’s greatest bands. Frontman **Tom Warrior** kept good on his word to continue the musical journey he rekindled when Frost reformed in 2001. **Triptykon**’s first album _Eparistera Daimones_ is in every way a peer of Fischer’s career highlights, including _Morbid Tales_ and _To Mega Therion_. It’s part therapy session, part diatribe against former band members and all the morbid we expect from Warrior. After a career of disappointments and struggles this was Warrior’s year: a powerful new book; a successful tour, an EP and one of the best albums of the year and his storied career. “Goetia” and “Abyss Within My Soul,” sound just as powerful live as classics like “Procreation Of The Wicked.” _Eparistera Daimones_ is likely to outlast even **Celtic Frost**’s swan song _Monotheist_. **Justin M. Norton**

## 2\. ENSLAVED - _Axioma Ethica Odini_

### (Nuclear Blast)

![](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/02.jpg "02")With a captivating live performance fresh in mind, I can't help but consider **Enslaved**'s new opus, _Axioma Ethica Odini_ another success in the near flawless catalogue that the band continues to add to at an incredible pace (especially considering the type of progressive/psychadelic/black metal that they produce). The sounds are familiar, as they continue in the same path they've been venturing since _Below The Lights_, but still remain fresh and unpredictable. Their songwriting continues to grow, winding delicate interludes around thundering riffs underneath combinations of vicious growls and soothing clean vocals. The constantly evolving Enslaved have created yet another winner, and once again prove that they are masters of their craft. **Adam Wills**

## 1\. AGALLOCH - _Marrow Of The Spirit_

### (Profound Lore)

![](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/01.jpg "01") The decision to name Agalloch's _Marrow of the Spirit_ as top album of the year was an easy decision to make. It's a record that offers sonic layers and subtle reprises that reveal themselves more each the album is played. This depth means that it even lends itself to communal listening experiences with multiple pairs of ears. Like the rest of the band's catalogue, it is both melancholic and spiteful. However, elements such as **John Haughm**'s stressed vocals push the band further than we've heard in the past, adding to the sense of urgency that the album offers. Far from simple nostalgia, _Marrow of the Spirit_ melds the contemporary world of metal music with an invitation to make a connection with the flow of the environment around you. **Jonathan Smith**
