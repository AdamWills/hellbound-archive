Bah, humbug! Christmas has come and gone, and hopefully next year King Diamond’s wish will come true. No presents for Christmas…

It’s been a month since his open heart surgery, according to his wife Livia’s posting at the official King Diamond website (covenworldwide.org), and thankfully his recovery is coming along well. Listen to the King belt it out, and please send your well-wishes, prayers and thoughts to the man of metallic royalty.

Love,

Jay H. Gorania
