**By Sean and Spencer Palmerston**

Earlier this evening a digital promo showed up for the much lauded **GHOST** album on Rise Above that has been getting a lot of praise in the European metal press. I decided to throw on their album and my three year old son piped in, unasked, after the first four songs, to give me his two cents on the album:

"This is not the girls music. This is unkind. There are no engines allowed. It's the rock music"

Well, okay then. I don't think we could have said it better ourselves.
