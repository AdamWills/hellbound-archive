110 centimetres of snow?! Of course, soon as I open my yap on-air to poke fun at Fearless Leader Palmerston going away on a pre-Christmas family vacation to a place where there’s a 110 centimetres of snow on the ground, it starts snowing like a mother fucker here in Hamilton. It may not have been anything near what Sean is experiencing up in his winter wonderland, but in order to make up for it, we played 110 centimetres of Drudkh.
