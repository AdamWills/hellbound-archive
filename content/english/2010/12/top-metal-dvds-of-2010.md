[![](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/rushdoc.jpg "rushdoc")](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/rushdoc.jpg) One of the optional categories that all Hellbound contributors were asked to write about in our year end polls was their favourite Metal DVD of 2010. As it was optional - and because not all of us watched music DVDs in 2010 - not everyone has participated but I think that it is obvious from those that had a favourite to offer that the new _RUSH: Beyond The Lighted Stage_ documentary was hands down the favourite, followed by the Norwegian black metal documentary _Until The Light Takes Us_. Here are the individual favourite Metal DVDs of 2010, in alphabetical order by contributing writers.
