Kevin Stewart-Panko and Sean Palmerston interviewed **Mike Thompson** of **Withered** when they played at Hamiltonâ€™s Club Absinthe last Thursday night. The show was part of their current tour with label mates Landmine Marathon and Skeletonwitch. Topics discussed include touring in cold weather, accidents in the snow, their recent tour with Danzig, their new album that was recently released on Prosthetic Records and one of our favourite topics - VINYL.
