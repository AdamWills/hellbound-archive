**By Gruesome Greg**

When I was told that the new album from **Endless Boogie** would be arriving in my mailbox, my response was (and I quote) “Endless Boogie? I can only imagine what they sound like. (Grand Funk Railroad on speed!?)” Actually, my estimation wasn't too far off. Picture a buncha hipsters jamming to Kyuss and The Stooges along with Mark Farner and company in a Brooklyn basement, and you've basically got the idea.

While not quite endless, this eight-track boogie lasts over 76 minutes, an average of nine and a half per tune. That said, I prefer their shorter, 4-6 minute numbers, as the longer ones are a tad repetitive and not quite interesting enough to keep my attention for eight to 10 minutes. Vocals are a weak point, their singer adopting the stoned-hippie, Eddie Glass, garage-rock wail for the most part, cept when he gives a third-rate John Garcia on opener “Empty Eye,” the record's most prominent desert rock moment.

And then there's the grande finale, “A Life Worth Leaving,” which runs 22 and a half minutes long. The lo-fi, mostly-instro jam is pretty decent, but these guys could learn a thing or two from listening to some more Earthless.
