This week’s installment of the ‘Hellbound Handshake Clip of the Week,’ features some footage from the upcoming ‘Untitled Brutal Truth Documentary,’ currently in post-production at Handshake headquarters.

The documentary was filmed over three days in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where **Brutal Truth** headlined the Manitoba Metal Fest. In March of 2010, a three-person crew from Handshake traveled to Winnipeg and immersed themselves in the local scene.

The clip features footage of **Rich Hoak** getting picked up at the airport by Manitoba Metal Fest guru and Putrescence drummer **Corey X**…(where they spotted **Henry Winkler** aka **The Fonz** arriving on another flight) as well as footage from a show that happened at Winnipeg’s ‘War On Music’ the night before Brutal Truth played.

The War on Music show footage features a performance by **Head Hits Concrete**, an amazing grind core band from Winnipeg, and a performance by **Peacemaker**, which is Rich Hoak’s spoken-word, guerrilla-core, one-man extravaganza.

The ‘Untitled Brutal Truth Documentary’ is not slated for release yet, but will most likely premiere in late 2010.
