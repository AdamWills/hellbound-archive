**By Rob Kachluba**

The second offering from this Polish progressive rock outfit sees them going for a more atmospheric laden sound than their debut, which has created a far more mellow and less obviously progressive direction on album number two.There are a few occasions where they break out into some heavy riffing but for the most part this a relaxed album that brings to mind Riverside and Porcupine Tree with some Opeth-like moments thrown in. The drum work is intelligent, the two guitarists have different styles to catch the individual moment of every song, the singer is very good with his vocal melodies and when this sucker is played loud the production just sounds incredible. The amazing thing about this release is the drastic change from their debut; with some work put in by the listener they will be rewarded with such a intelligent laid back prog masterpiece. This new direction may put off some of the heavier progmetal fans out there but if you are willing to put in the time and this could sit nicely by years end for top ten material.
