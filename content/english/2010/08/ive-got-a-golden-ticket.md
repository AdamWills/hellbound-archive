Though it's still more than a month away, I've been counting the days till September 11th for a little while now.  I'm not some sick creep who gets off on seeing the Twin Towers fall, nor an American patriot who watches the all-day memorials playing ad nauseum on cable news networks.  (I'm not even American, but you knew that already...)

Do I remember where I was when the planes hit?  Yes.  Do I care to remember it?  No, not really.  But September 11 is about to become a much more memorable date for me moving forward...

(Wait for it...)

# _**SLEEP PLAYS HOLY MOUNTAIN, BITCHES!!!**_

While I had long known about Sleep's plans to reunite (well sorta, drummer Chris Hakius is outta the picture, sadly) for the [ATP Festival](http://www.atpfestival.com/events/atpnewyork2010.php) on Labour Day Weekend, along with Iggy and the Stooges, Sunn O and Boris, I ultimately decided that a three-day, outdoor music festival in Buttfucknowhere, NY was not my cuppa tea.  After all, Iggy had already rocked the block at [NXNE](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/reviews/concerts/nxne10.html), Boris are in town in two days, and Sunn is only slightly more listenable that [Blackwolfgoat](http://www.hellbound.ca/2010/07/blackwolfgoat-dragonwizardsleeve/), in my books.

But when I heard that the band (Pike and Cisneros are joined by Neurosis drummer Jason Roeder) was playing a handful of dates following the festival, including [Music Fest Northwest](http://musicfestnw.com/lineup/) in Portland--with muthafuckin' YOB(!) and Scott Kelly solo(!?) as support--I knew that I couldn't miss it.  Y'know, if the ticket said Sleep Plays Dopesmoker, that would be pretty cool, but to hear the incomparable [_Holy Mountain_](http://www.hellbound.ca/2009/08/sleeps-holy-mountain/) it its entirety?  Fuck me sideways with a Cessna!  Never mind that I've never been to Portland before, don't know my way around and don't really know anybody who lives there.  Tis a trip well worth taking for yours truly.

That being said, if you're in the Portland or Seattle area, and know of any good restaurants, record stores and/or other sites worth seeing, I should have a couple hours to kill before the show, so feel free to comment or [drop me a line](mailto:gruesomegreg@toohightogetitright.com).

While Sleep's show is by far my most anticipated upcoming event, I've got more than one ticket that's got me circling dates on the calendar.  In no particular order...

**BORIS w/ Russian Circles @ Lee's Palace (Toronto), August 9th.** From the land of Japan, Boris is an intense live experience.  I'm secretly hoping they've stashed Ian Astbury in a suitcase to sing some tunes from [their new EP](http://blog.southernlord.com/?p=271)...

**MELVINS w/ guests @ Opera House (Toronto), September 1st.** The Melvins have not played in Toronto in 10 years.  While I have no clue who their guests will be (they're playing an [Amphetamine Reptile Records anniversary gig](http://themelvins.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=121&Itemid=1) in Minny a few days prior), I'm hoping they eschew the opening band entirely for an extended set of dual-drumkit debauchery!

**Montreal is Doomed Festival @ Les Katacombes (Montreal), December 4th.** The first-ever North American appearance of cult doomsters [Pagan Altar](http://www.myspace.com/paganaltar), along with Blood Ceremony and a coupla franco-doom bands.  Well worth the bus trip to La Belle Province...

and last, but not least:

**Seattle SEAHAWKS vs. San Francisco 49ers @ Qwest Field (Seattle), September 12th.** After seeing my favourite band in concert, I'll be jetting over to Seattle to catch my favourite football team.  Been a long-time Seahawks fan, going back to '98, when they lured Mike Holmgren away from the Green Bay Packers.  Catching their season-opener at the loudest stadium on earth will be the icing on the cake of an incredible weekend.  Did I mention that I shilled out for a front-row seat?

Let's just say that if a plane crash-lands into the Great Lakes, or Allah forbid, the CN Tower on September 13th, I'll have died a happy man.

Peace,

Greg

_P.S.: I'll be playing a whole buncha Boris on Smokin' Green tonite, along with some Church of Misery and Eternal Elysium.  Be sure to tune in from 1 till 3 am (10 pm till midnite Pacific Time!) at 88.1 fm on yer radio, channel 947 on yer TV or [www.ckln.fm](http://www.ckln.fm/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=150&Itemid=205) on yer computer!_
