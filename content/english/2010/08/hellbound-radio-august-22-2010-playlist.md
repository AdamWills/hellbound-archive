**Commentary and organization by Kevin Stewart-Panko**

Jesus Christ…I go away for a month and everything goes to a shambles. The station from which we broadcast Hellbound Radio every Sunday has begun the process of being gutted in order to be moved to a still undetermined location sometime in the next nine months – nothing like planning ahead, eh? Half the college seems to be under construction as well, which makes getting to the actual station after hours a bit of a pain in the ass. Then, there are my esteemed co-hosts who failed to put up a single playlist while I was away. So, here you go, Sunday night’s goods. And as a heads up for everyone involved and those of you who enjoy perusing our playlist here on hellbound.ca (when you really could be listening), I’m going to be away at least two weekends in September, one in October and one in November.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
