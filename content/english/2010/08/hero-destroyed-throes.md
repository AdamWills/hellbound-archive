**By Matt Lewis**

**Hero Destroyed** is a band borne out of the rusted steel wreckage of Pittsburgh PA. This five piece, which includes the drummer from deceased Commit Suicide(loved that band), has just released _Throes_, their second album to come out on Relapse. **Throes i**s a little surprising when compared to their last self-titled effort. Their last album was short, fast, heavy and technical but not overly so. It was an album that was punishing and didn’t stick around long enough to ask where it hurts.

Not a lot has changed in their sound, they are still the angry, abrasive modern musicians they always were, but they have evolved their sound to include a melodic passage or two and have gone with longer songs. While there are still the short to the point songs they have melded some songs combining melody with rage and it works quite well. Most bands that stagnant in their creativity die and while some can get away with this bands like Hero Destroyed are the perfect example of honing a sound and slowly expanding to create a different listening experience. The band sound like a mix of Burnt By the Sun and, in a way, Blessings the Hogs (but not as unfocused as BTH). Contained within the riffs are elements of thrash and hardcore but it’s a great blend, like nabob coffee or that guy on the donkey coffee. If you like modern metal with adrenaline fueled rage and with a little of intelligence thrown in, feel free to pour a cup.
