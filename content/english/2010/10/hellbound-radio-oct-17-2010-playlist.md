Nothing really to report this week as a stunning lack of excitement plagued the Hellbound Radio booth and actually had me nodding off at one point. When I was a kid I used to fall asleep listening to _Show No Mercy_. People still wonder how the fuck I was able to manage that. Don’t really know myself, but when you’re fucking tired, you’re fucking tired and if there’s one thing metal can stave off, it’s the luxurious slink off into the world of total relaxation.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at  [www.indifm.ca](http://www.indifm.ca)

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
