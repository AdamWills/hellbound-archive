We think an immigration snafu made it so that Albert was unable to attend this weekend’s festivities. Too bad, because he missed out on our playing the metal trivia board game [**Metal Mental Meltdown**](http://heavymetaladdiction.com/2008/01/16/cd-scavenger-hunt-metal-mental-meltdown-heavy-metal-trivia-board-game/) on air as we spun the tunes. Loaded with all kinds of obscure trivia about bands and albums I’ve never heard of – at least it seemed that way whenever it was my turn on the hotseat – Albert, with his unerring knowledge of Pretty Maids history, would have cleaned our clocks. Suffice to say, I was choking on Sean’s dust all night and when the final scores were tabulated, had only managed half the points as our fearless leader. But I guess that’s what happens when he lands on questions asking him “Who was Motorhead’s original guitarist?” and I get a gems like “What instrument does Ken Tamblyn play?” Like, who the fuck is Ken Tamblyn?

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at [www.indifm.ca](http://www.indifm.ca)

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
