**By Rob Hughes**

Give it up for the drummer! Not only did **District 97** percussionist **Jonathan Schang** write and produce almost all of his band’s debut album, he and his bandmates managed to draft both a Chicago Symphony Orchestra cellist to enhance their sound and a former American Idol finalist to front them. Mad genius. Suddenly this more-than-capable outfit had an image and a promotional hook for hacks like me to seize upon.

_Hybrid Child_ is effervescent and fun, a mostly harmless romp through progressive rock territory. District 97’s edge can be found in the way vocalist **Leslie Hunt** carries the melodies and the staccato riffing that anchors most of the tracks—you can sorta tell that a drummer composed them. Hunt’s voice has just the right amount of swagger and attitude. She’s not just off on her own Idol trip; she’s actively listening and getting into it. Even when the band gets heavy—“Termites” has some sub-Meshuggah moments that a bigger budget might have bolstered—she’s there to let loose a scream (albeit one that won’t give Grace Perry any sleepless nights). Katinka Kleijn‘s cello mucks in as well with rapid-fire lines that are a far cry from the syrupy strings that a lot of bands use to pad out the slow bits.

The album itself is pretty front-loaded, with four relatively brief, catchy songs before the 27-minute “Mindscan,” a 10-part saga that has its moments (“VIII: What Do They Want?” is quite ripping), but doesn’t sustain momentum. Maybe now that they’ve made their “Fountain of Lamneth,” they’ll lay a “2112” on us next time out. In the meantime, there’s always “I Don’t Wanna Wait Another Day” and “I Can’t Take You With Me,” a double-shot of gleaming, intricate-yet-hummable rockers off the top of the album to enjoy. Disenchanted fans of Spock’s Beard and Dream Theater should book a visit to District 97 ASAP.
