Looking at this week’s playlist, holy fuck did we play a lot of our fellow home and native men! Broadcast regulations up here in Canada require that a certain percentage of what we play is supposed to be Canadian content, hence the term “Can-Con” which some of you non-Canukleheads might have wondered about. Generally, we’re pretty lax on our Can-Con quotient and despite how much shit we get from the program director, we’re still pretty lax about our Can-Con metal quotient. Not for any particular reason other than it doesn’t really cross our minds when going through our collections and pulling CDs off the shelf each week.

I don’t know if it was the sense of patriotism lurking in the background because our country can’t possibly have hosted a more universally maligned athletic competition than the folks in New Delhi have with the Commonwealth Games this month or because we’re feeling all warm and rosy because it’s Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend, but there was a lot of Can-metal thrown on the table this week. Whatever the case, it helped take the sting out of Sean kicking everyone’s ass in round two of Metal Mental Meltdown.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
