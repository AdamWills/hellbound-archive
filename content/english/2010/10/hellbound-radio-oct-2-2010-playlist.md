Wow! Three phone calls in one night! Must be some sort of record. Never you mind that two of them sounded like they came from the same (probably very drunk) guy asking about Johnny Cash and Baptized In Blood before wondering about some obscure Teutonic metalcore that somehow made it on air, and the other was from the station manager making sure we weren’t fucking goats in the foyer. Again. It might help if we gave out the request line number more than once a month, but then we’d probably whine about people calling up and asking to repeatedly hear Children of Bodom. No Halloween show next week; we’ve declared Halloween as unofficially having nothing to do with metal. That’s the sort of thing that happens when you have kids.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
