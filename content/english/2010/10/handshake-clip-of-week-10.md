After a brief break we are back with the Handshake Hellbound Clip Of the Week! And this week's is a doozie. Here is a new video that was made for the recent **TODAY IS THE DAY** North American tour. The video is for the title track from the band's amazing _Temple Of The Morning Star_ album, released in the late 90s on Relapse. And without further adieu...
