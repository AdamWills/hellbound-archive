Last weekend, when I was on my way to the bank, I passed a cheap sign on Bloor St saying "1000s of vinyls, thattaway."  Intrigued, I followed the arrow up a residential street (I think it was Brunswick) to a parkette with a buncha milk crates laid out on the ground.

This is why I love The Annex.  Where else can you find a vinyl parkette sale in late September?

The first crate I came across contained a copy of _Concerto for Group and Orchestra_, Deep Purple and the Royal Philharmonic, German pressing.  Okay, I knew I'd be dropping a couple dollars here.  A couple minutes later, the well-worn green sleeve of ZZ Top's _Tres Hombres_ caught my eye.  Not a bad afternoon right there...

The bearded dude hovering over the crates told me that the records were two bucks each or, he said with a gleam in his eye, "If you see something else you like, I can give you three for five dollars."  I knew what that meant...  _KISS Alive!_, muthafucka!

I gotta say, that Deep Purple orchestral record is some trippy shit, classical music mixed with heavy DP grooves.  _Tres Hombres_ is a blues-rock classic.  "La Grange" gets overplayed on every classic rock station known to man, but it really is a solid record, from start to finish.

As for _Alive!_, well, my enjoyment of the quintessential live double-album was severely hampered as a large chunk was missing from the second record--almost as if someone got too high, mistook the vinyl for a pizza, and took a bite outta the fucking thing.  It still plays, mind you, but I'm forced to skip "Watchin' You" on Side 3 and "Rock Bottom" on Side 4, so that the needle doesn't drop.  Unfortunately, the vinyl vendors had packed up and left by the time I came to this realization--and besides, I'm not sure that guy woulda given me my buck-fifty back, anyways.

Oh well, you win some, you lose some, I suppose...

Peace,

Greg
