This month, we've done something a little different for our Staff Playlist. In the spirit of the most metal holiday of the year, we've come up with our top 10 Halloween inspired songs. Whether they're directly about Halloween, Halloween related topics, or just give us that tingle down our spine, these songs should get you in the mood for a chilling Halloween.

## Adrien Begrand

1\. Wendy Carlos & Rachel Elkind - "The Shining - Main Theme" 2. 45 Grave - "Partytime" (1983 album version) 3. Helloween - "Halloween" 4. Alice Cooper - "The Ballad of Dwight Frye" 5. Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds - "Red Right Hand" 6. Bauhaus - "She's in Parties" 7. Suicide - "Frankie Teardrop" 8. Krzysztof Penderecki - "Symphony No. 3: Passacaglia – Allegro Moderato" 9. Emperor - "Inno A Satana" 10. Krzysztof Komeda - "Rosemary's Baby Main Theme - Vocal" Film/Book: The Shining, Stanley Kubrick, Stephen King (respectively)

## Kyle Harcott

**Tracks One through Five: Getting the Fear** 1. Goblin - Witch 2. Pica - Caller On Line 1 3. Krzysztof Penderecki - Polymorphia (actually, all of Penderecki’s works on this soundtrack freeze my blood) 4. Throbbing Gristle - Hamburger Lady 5. Acid Bath - Jezebel **Tracks Six through Ten: Obvious but Autumn/Samhain-mandatory** 6. Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath 7. Misfits - Horror Business 8. Electric Hellfire Club - Halloween Medley 9. Glenn Danzig - Black Aria (whole album) 10. The Cramps - I Was A Teenage Werewolf Book: Hollywood Hex: An Illustrated History of Cursed Movies, Mikita Brottman (Creation Cinema) Movie: Les Sept Jours Du Talion

## Rob Hughes

1\. Univers Zero – La Faulx (Imagine the music from the shower scene in Psycho drawn out into a 25-minute epic of mounting terror. Horrific, in the best possible sense of the word.) 2. Helloween - Halloween (So I had to go on goddamn YouTube and watch the video for this song for the first time in 20 years. Now I’m doing my best to wipe it from my memory again. “Hey, it was the ’80s!” is no excuse.) 3. Mike Oldfield - Tubular Bells (The first bit anyway. An obvious choice, but hey, when are you going to play this if not on Halloween?) 4. Bob Drake - The Skull Mailbox and Other Horrors (Might as well include the entire album. Fearsome heads, horrible gardens, hideous portraits, and demented statuary abound on this 27-track curiosity shop from arch freakazoid Drake.) 5. KISS - King of the Night-time World (As seen on the Paul Lynde Halloween Special, one of the pivotal moments of my childhood.) 6. Celtic Frost - Danse Macabre (The most morbid tale of all.) 7. Deceased - Fearless Undead Machines (Again, just play the whole album, because zombie-themed thrash metal is the best thrash metal.) 8. Morte Macabre - Apoteosi del Mistero (Swedish prog heads pay tribute to ’70s horror soundtracks. Here be Goblin(s), reinterpreted with creepy-as-hell Mellotrons.) 9. Mercyful Fate - The Oath (Sure, King’s also got “Halloween,” but this one really induces satanic panic.) 10. Peter Hammill - The Haunted Palace (The best song from Hammill’s Fall of the House of Usher opera. As Roderick Usher sings this song, Madeline’s true condition gradually becomes apparent…)

1\. The Monster Mash 2. Misfits - Halloween 3. King Diamond - Halloween 4. That one Type O Negative song that groans on about Halloween 5. Is "Damage Inc." about Halloween? 7.
