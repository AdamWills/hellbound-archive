**By Kevin Stewart-Panko**

I’m going to go out on a not-so-brittle limb and say that the radio show that is loosely associated with this website is probably one of the most diverse heavy/extreme music programs on the face of this ridiculous planet. This is due in large part of the tastes, collections, whims and tolerant attitudes of myself and my co-hosts. Really, where else are you going to hear **Megadeth, Deeds of Flesh, Scorpions, Rotten Sound** and **Yakuza** in the same show? When was the last time anyone cracked open **Morgion**’s _**Among Majestic Ruin**_? Has anyone outside of Brazil even heard of **Korzus**? This is the sort of musical roller coaster Hellbound Radio will take you on. To prove it - and to finally start promoting the show we’ve been doing for four years now - we’re going to start posting our detailed playlists a day or two after each on-air stint. Take a listen sometime; I guaranteed you’ll be either surprised as shit, amazed, confused or totally pissed off at the massive scope of diversity our show delivers.

**Hellbound Radio** airs every Sunday, 9-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at [www.indifm.ca](http://www.indifm.ca)

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
