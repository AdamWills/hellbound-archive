**Steve Truglio** is a professional photographer from the USA who has had his shots appear in publications such as The Aquarian and Metal Maniacs, as well as a number of albums by Clutch. One of Steve's favourite bands of all time is **Rush** and he has been lucky enough to shoot them live a number of times over the years. Steve was nice enough to let us print a photo gallery of some of his favourite Rush pics he has taken, all of which can be seen below.

A few words about the photos. These shots were taken over a series of different concerts dating back to 2002. The shot of Alex with the Barbie fans was from a show that took place June 13, 2007 in Atlanta, GA at HiFi Buys Amphitheater, as is the bigger shot of Alex and Geddy directly above it. The second and third photo shown (Alex and Neil) were taken on June 14, 2008  at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia. The final shot of the band, which shows Neil Peart smiling, was taken at the Meadows Music Center in Hartford, CT on June 28th, 2002. That show was the band's first show back after their five year absence from the stage and it is a photo that Steve is especially proud of.

We hope you enjoy them all. Thanks again to Steve for letting us print them and make sure to check out his radio show, **MY SHOW with Undercover Steve**, that can be heard online at [http://myshow667.podomatic.com/](http://myshow667.podomatic.com). I believe his July 2nd show is going to feature a lot of Rush...
