In an ongoing attempt to show that our Hellbound radio programs are some of the most varied, interesting metal radio shows that can be heard on the radio/online, here is our playlist to last night's edition of the **HELLBOUND SUMMER METAL MELTDOWN**. Kevin wasn't around for this program, as he was preparing for his upcoming summer tour acting as road manager for **CEPHALIC CARNAGE**, but we did have another guest DJ in for the night.

Hellbound contributor, photographer and web guru **Adam Wills** came onto the show with Albert and Sean last night. It was his first ever experience on the radio and was a natural. It was also the first time we have ever been able to play vinyl LPs on the show, as CFMU has two operating turntable in the studio, so we played one of the vinyl only bonus tracks off the latest YOB album as part of the show. Here is what the three of us played in the ninety minutes that made up last night's show.

**Hellbound Summer Metal Meltdown** airs every Saturday, 10:30 until midnight EST on CFMU FM, McMaster U Community Radio in Hamilton ON. Listen online at [http://cfmu.mcmaster.ca](http://cfmu.mcmaster.ca) 

Your hosts are Adam Wills, Albert Mansour and Sean Palmerston.
