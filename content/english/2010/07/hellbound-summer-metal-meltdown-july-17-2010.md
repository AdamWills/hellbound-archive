In an ongoing attempt to show that our Hellbound radio programs are some of the most varied, interesting metal radio shows that can be heard on the radio/online, here is our playlist to last night’s edition of the **HELLBOUND SUMMER METAL MELTDOWN**. Kevin wasn’t around for this program, as he has left on tour acting as road manager for **CEPHALIC CARNAGE**, but we did have another guest DJ in for the night.

Hellbound contributor, photographer and web guru **Adam Wills** once again came onto the show with Albert and Sean last night.  Here is what the three of us played in the ninety minutes that made up last night’s show.

**Hellbound Summer Metal Meltdown** airs every Saturday, 10:30 until midnight EST on CFMU FM, McMaster U Community Radio in Hamilton ON. Listen online at [http://cfmu.mcmaster.ca](http://cfmu.mcmaster.ca/)

Your hosts are Adam Wills, Albert Mansour and Sean Palmerston.
