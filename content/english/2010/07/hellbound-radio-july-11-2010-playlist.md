So in our ongoing new efforts to show the world that we have one of the most diverse metal radio shows on the planet, here is the playlist to last night’s edition of Hellbound Radio. This is our last show with all three of us for a while, as **Kevin Stewart-Panko** heads out on tour with **CEPHALIC CARNAGE** later this week. He will be tour-managing them for the first half of this summer’s **SUMMER SLAUGHTER** tour and we wish him the best of luck!

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday night from 9 PM until midnight on INDI 101 in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen live online at [http://www.indifm.ca](http://www.indifm.ca)

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Kevin Stewart-Panko and Sean Palmerston
