_(You may have noticed that our last clip o' the week featuring Jucifer was almost a week late; if you didn't now you know why there are two videos in less than four days now you do...)_

Wow, we are already up to our sixth Hellbound HandshakeÂ Clip of the Week and this one is pretty neat. Last weekend the Handshake Inc folks were shooting a music video for one of our fave Canadian bands, WOODS OF YPRES, and have given us some cool outtakes. Here is video footage of the band's David Gold jumping into a river with a woman with a digital camera in hand, and then two more clips of Mr. Gold diving into some water by himself. Well, enough of my blathering - check it out for yourself!
