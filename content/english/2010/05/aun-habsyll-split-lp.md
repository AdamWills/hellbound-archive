[![PG019](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/PG019-300x300.jpg "PG019")](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/PG019.jpg) **By Kyle Harcott** With little foreknowledge of the bands, and even less patience for stare-at-your-shoes-and-drool drone metal, I wasn’t exactly sure if I was the best guy to give this disc a spin. Sure, I can appreciate the power of a well-placed, drawn-out power chord, but draw it out too long and I start looking at my watch. So it was with trepidation that I undertook this review.

Upon first listen to the lead-off track, “Druids”, from Montreal’s **AUN**, I was left with the aural impression of a great mechanical beast forming out of the thin air. The song doesn’t so much start as just kind of throbs into being - and from there, continues throbbing its way through thirteen minutes. Based around a loping drum track, a morose three-note ‘riff’ (for lack of a better word), and a shitload of eerie keyboard effects, that’s the best way I can describe “Druids”. AUN has taken the art of drone to its logical spacerock extreme, enough so that I am going to revolutionize metal journalism by hereby coining yet another subgenre: Spacedrone. You heard it here first, folks. I think. As a point of reference, I kept thinking of Vangelis’ themes from Blade Runner while I listened to this track.

AUN’s second contribution to the LP is “FallOut” and while things start out a little more melodic here, the song quickly devolves into a loop of ambient chaos, with layers upon layers of almost recognizable machine noises and ambient keyboard loops. With its mid-tempo drum loop, and semblance of melody in its keys, it’s almost the polar opposite of its predecessor.

Then there’s the seriously WTF?, tempo-obliterating force of nature known only as **Habsyll** from Toulouse, France, and they are the very dictionary definition of drone metal. Their track “Habsyll (IV)” starts out with background noise (I think I heard chains falling into a bucket), some well-trained feedback, and intermittent keyboard-induced gongs. Then at the 4:19 mark comes the most heinous atomic bomb of a chord I ever heard, and they keep coming thick like molasses. But it was about halfway through the song that I found myself seriously pondering how the drummer managed to keep count. Of course, it was at precisely that point that the song evolves into something more resembling a song. The vocals kick in here, and resemble more the guttural howls of a mortally-wounded animal than anything remotely human. Then, briefly, the song takes a detour into blackmetal hardcore territory, only to devolve back to Dronesville again for the rest of its 23-minute duration

All in all, this split LP is a challenging listen, especially if you are not the biggest fan of drone like me. Ultimately, I found it rewarding, but only as background music.
