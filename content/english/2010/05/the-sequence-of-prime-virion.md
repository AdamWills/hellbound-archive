**By Kyle Harcott**

It’s amazing when you take a blind chance on an album, only to have it lovingly rip your head off. This is exactly what happened to me with _Virion_, the second self-released album by Plainville, Kansas artist Brandon Duncan, who records under the nom de guerre of The Sequence of Prime. I stumbled across his website on the recommendation of another metal writer, and upon several listens, I can tell you _Virion_ is without a doubt one of the most original, incredible, and downright vitriolic records I have heard in a very long time.

Fill a Yahtzee cup with dice comprised of black-tar hate-sludge, incite-to-riot industrial, a bit of double-bass-heavy thrash, mebbe a tinge of blackmetal - shake virulently, and you might come close to approximating the desperate, foaming-at-the-mouth rage of _Virion_. A concept album based on a viral particle’s pandemic effects upon everything it infects in its path, from one person to a species to the entire planet. Severely frightening, both lyrically and musically, _Virion_ is an intricate masterwork of fraught aggression; Brandon Duncan is the clear next-in-line to carry that pissed-off, white-hot torch lit by Steves Albini and Austin. The list of influences on his MySpace reads like a Honor Roll of stab-you-in-the-face-rock over the last thirty years.

“TRA-VEL-LING THROUGH SPACE AND TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME!” wrenches the first wretched wail from my speakers. The lead track, “Enlightenment”, is jarring enough to snap me to attention, because I haven’t heard anything this oh-please-god-help-me direful since my first listen to _Temple of the Morning Star_ back in 1997. Everything sounds like some terror-stricken, all-too-late call to alarm - all white-knuckle frenetic, vicious and plaintive, but then, the song simply stops almost as soon as it starts. Track three, “Backlit”, is the standout here, with its battle-cry chorus, all-over-the-map –and to my sincere surprise programmed- drums, and more of that abominable, last-man-on-the-planet bawling; the song drags the listener across a scorched landscape of post-apocalypse Earth, not as some sort of altruistic warning but more as a foregone conclusion - and things only get worse from there. “Extremophile” chronicles the suffocation of the planet as seen from afar, a caustic paean to a supernova.

There is not a lot of hope to be found in _Virion_. You’re not left with that usual peaceful sense of everything’ll be alright by the end because it’s just not that kind of record. There’s a sense of helpless awe, perhaps even a smidge of malefic compliance, at what the forces of nature will undoubtedly someday reclaim from humanity’s excesses.

Ultimately, the listener should be left with a tremendous respect for Brandon Duncan and The Sequence of Prime, because this is one artist to keep an eye on. I have a feeling his records will only get better and better. The best review I can give of this overwhelming record is to tell you to take the same chance on it that I did. It may not be pretty, but it is a challenging, rewarding listen, and it’s available for free download at [http://www.thesequenceofprime.com/](http://www.thesequenceofprime.com) .
