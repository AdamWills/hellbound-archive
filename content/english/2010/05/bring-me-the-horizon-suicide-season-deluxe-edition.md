**By Keith Carman**

It seems strange that an album barely hitting its two-year mark is already being treated to something as grandiose as three discs featuring the original album, remixes and a DVD sporting a complete live show/four videos.

However, when one realizes how **Bring Me The Horizon** (BMTH) have taken over the metalcore scene (sounding much like contemporaries Architects, Bleeding Through and the like) so quickly since this refined 2008 opus was released, it sort of rationalizes things.

Streamlining their sound from 2006 debut _Count Your Blessings_ for their Epitaph Records debut, the band factored in a greater deal of harmonies to their death-influenced, hardcore-founded style. The end result was a divergent sound that settled easily on young ears. Not only could kiddies rage but they could sing along too.

To that extent, this deluxe rendition is an impressive repackaging of the devil we're familiar with. Updated sound quality, ensures the original music is broader; has more of a foundation as well as equalized levels, which is about all that can be said. Again, we know it already and not much has changed.

Moving into the remixes—dubbed Cut Up—is a different story altogether. The likes of Ben Weinman, Travis McCoy, KC Blitz and Robotsonics offer their unique hands at messing with BMTH's creations with results never straying from “interesting” but never reaching “captivating.” Most heavy music fans could take it but will most likely leave it.

As for the visual portion, both Live In Mexico City and Live In Siberia are engaging, as is the collection of videos featuring tracks “Chelsea Smile,” “Diamonds Aren't Forever,” “The Comedown” and “The Sadness Will Never End.” Once again though, how often one will feel driven to utilize this disc is questionable.

Overall, yes, this offering is brimming with value but the jury is out on whether or not that's impulse or extended. Still, with its improved quality, bountiful bonuses and footing in solid new school 'core, there have been far worse ways to part with hard-earned dollars than _Suicide Season_'s Deluxe version.
