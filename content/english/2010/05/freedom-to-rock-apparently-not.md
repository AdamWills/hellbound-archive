Perhaps you've heard that the Global Marijuana March went down today.  Can't say I was there--it's a pretty long walk, and I'm sick with pneumonia.  No longer a self-contained event, our local march has been incorporated into a larger event called the [Toronto Freedom Festival](http://www.torontofreedomfestival.com/indexMain.shtml), an over-hyped sit-in/outdoor concert at Queen's Park.

Being that I run a website called [Too High To Get It Right](http://www.toohightogetitright.com) and host a radio show called [Smokin' Green](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/smokingreen.html), I've been receiving press releases for this festival for several months now.  Not sure why you'd need a media pass for a free event, unless you had a camera crew in tow or plans to interview some of the bands.  A quick glance over the festival lineup does not present itself with any interview opportunities for yours truly--not for this site or any other outlets that I write for.

Let's see what we have here...  A "hypnotic sitar drum 'n' bass circus"?  Pass.  A hip hop DJ, noted as a "main resident at a majority of Toronto's leading nightclubs"?  No thank you.  A Bob Marley tribute band?  Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby...

Scrolling down past eight-hours' worth of MCs, DJs, and a band that's said to "embody the spirit of the Black Eyed Peas," I only spot one artist of semi-interest; [EOTO](http://www.myspace.com/eotomusic), an "electro jam band" featuring two guys from the String Cheese Incident.  But their set's just finishing as I type this.  Braving the elements to catch a glimpse of a couple guys from one of the big-name hippie bands amidst a sea of smelly stoners is not my idea of a good time.

[Earth](http://www.myspace.com/earthofficial) to the Freedom Fest organizers: We're not expecting [Garcia Plays Kyuss](http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/garcia-plays-kyuss/) or a [Sleep reunion gig](http://www.atpfestival.com/events/atpnewyork2010.php), but there are a few of us out there who happen to think that heavy guitar music goes well with weed.  Hopefully you'll keep this in mind for future installments.

Peace,

Greg
