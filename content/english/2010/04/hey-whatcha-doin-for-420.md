April 20th is the one day of the year where a DJ like yours truly can actually get a gig.  I'll be spinning tunes between bands at the [Chronic Rock Show](http://toohightogetitright.com/420hardluck1.jpg) this Tuesday at the Hard Luck Bar on Dundas, about half a block west of Bathurst.

Speaking of the bands, [Sin Dealer](http://www.myspace.com/sindealer) has a fair bit of stoner rock cred, with members of Sea of Green and Sons of OTIS included in their ranks, but they've got more of a straight ahead hard rock/metal sound.  [On The Verge](http://www.myspace.com/onthevergeca) sounds really good when you're stoned--see for yourself--but I have no clue what Oh How It Ended sounds like, stoned or not.

Anyways, the cover is $4.20, so make sure ya bring a couple dimes -- or they might hafta round it up to 5 bucks if they don't have enough small change (kinda like when bands try to be evil and set the cover at $6.66...  Has anybody ever provided exact change at one of those gigs?)

Since Smokin' Green doesn't air on the last Saturday of the month, it will be your only chance to catch me next week, so you might wanna mark it down...

Peace,

Greg

_P.S.: Smokin' Green will still air tonite, with tunes from Dead Meadow (in town this Thursday) and some of the other bands featured in the excellent documentary [Such Hawks, Such Hounds](http://www.suchhawkssuchhounds.com/).  Be sure to tune in from 1 till 3 am at 88.1 fm on yer radio, channel 947 on yer TV or [www.ckln.fm](http://www.ckln.fm) on yer computer!_
