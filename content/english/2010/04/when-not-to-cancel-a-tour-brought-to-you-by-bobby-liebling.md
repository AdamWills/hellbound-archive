Although Nebula has not yet divulged its reasons for breaking up right before their March/April tour was to begin (in fact, the canceled dates are still listed on their [MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/nebulamusic)), it can be assumed that their recently revolving door of drummers had something to do with it.  According to [their wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_(band)), they've had no less than three skin-pounders since they last circled North American waters.  My guess is that Jimmy Sweet reneged on his previous touring commitments, and it doesn't help that bassist Tom Davies is a native of England (although his current residence is unknown to me...)

On the other hand, when faced with the [11th hour departure](http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=102603019&blogId=530978868) of axeslinger Russ Strahan, Pentagram decided to honour their touring commitments, enlisting the former bass player--that's right, bass player--of Maryland doom band [Wretched](http://www.myspace.com/wretchedmd) as a last-minute replacement.  (For what it's worth, he currently plays guitar in a band called [Soul](http://www.myspace.com/stringtheorymusicband).)  The results have been nothing short of disastrous, with negative buzz coming in from [Indianapolis](http://www.hellridemusic.com/forum/showpost.php?p=376901&postcount=73) (the new capital of true doom) all the way to the stoned deserts of [L.A.](http://www.stonerrock.com/forums2/allposts.asp?Forum=ap686574459&ID=29029&StartAt=0)

(The L.A. link should hopefully work within a day or two, once [Stonerrock.com](http://www.stonerrock.com) gets its forums back online.  On that note, I was able to score _Jerusalem_ as my avatar over there.  Woulda preferred _Holy Mountain_, but I'll take it...)

Apparently bassist-turned-guitarist Johnny Wretched only knows a few Pentagram songs, and isn't prolific enough on his new instrument to learn any new tunes on the bus.  As a result, the band's been playing five- or six-song sets, centred around "Bobby's Boogie," a lengthy jam session where Bobby plays the harmonica and sings lyrics from "La Grange" and any other southern rock songs he can remember...  Don't get me wrong, [ZZ Top playing "La Grange" for 15 minutes is pretty badass](http://www.hellbound.ca/2009/12/zz-top-the-most-unlikely-arena-rock-band/), but Pentagram?  Not so much.

With the [band's checkered past](http://joehasselvander.blogspot.com/2009/01/gruesome-twosome-take-on-world-rebirth.html), I can see why Bobby opted for a fill-in rather than canceling a whole string of tour dates.  But one has to wonder whether the disappointing performances nite in and nite out will hurt Pentagram in the long run more than a canceled tour would.  And if they don't get their shit together in time for their headlining set at [MDF](http://www.marylanddeathfest.com/), they're bound to be blown off (if not booed off) the stage.

Will 2010 mark the end of Pentagram?  Probably not, since Bobby's got a [25-year-old wife](http://hal-coholic.blogspot.com/) with a baby on its way.  I don't think he's got any other way to support his family but to keep touring and releasing albums till he finally kicks the bucket.  But if he can't get a new, professional guitar player on board soon, he might hafta think up some new ways to make money.  [Bobby seems to think he's George Jung](http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2010/03/15/bobbylieblingspoketome/) (scroll down for it), so I don't wanna know what else is swirling around his drug-addled brain.  I'm just glad [I got to see Pentagram](http://www.hellbound.ca/2010/02/goodbye-cleveland/) when they still had a stable lineup...

Oh, and as for [that interview with Bobby](http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2010/03/15/bobbylieblingspoketome/), I think one disgusted fan [said it best](http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2010/03/15/bobbylieblingspoketome/comment-page-1/#comment-5220): "Bags of money, running coke from where, huh!?!? How about buying crack in southeast and taking it home (aka Mom & Dad’s place) in Arlington. I don’t mean to take personal jabs, but seriously- when you insult our intelligence in such ways it has to be said: bullshit."

Peace,

Greg
