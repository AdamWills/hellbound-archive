Who says Sunday's supposed to be a day of rest?  Here's what I've got planned for tomorrow:

12pm: Sons of OTIS jam session.  These guys are performing at [Roadburn](http://www.roadburn.com/roadburn-2010/) in a couple weeks, playing the iconic _Temple Ball_ album in its entirety.  Their jam space is some six blocks south of my house, so I'm getting a sneak preview.

3pm: The Great Northern Trendkill.  After a couple weeks off, I'm back co-hosting the CanCon heavy rock/metal show with my buddy Steve from Saskatchewan on [Indie Love Radio](http://indielove.ca/).

8pm: Acid Mothers Temple.  The Japanese experimental instro psych icons are making their annual pilgrimage to the El Mocambo, with support from Over-Gain Optimal Death.  Haven't gotten around to checking out the opening band yet, but they can't be any worse than [last year's tour mates](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/reviews/concerts/april1409.html)...

And of course, I'll be starting Sunday on a high note, as I do almost every week, with Smokin' Green on CKLN.  Be sure to tune in from 1 till 3 am for some down-tuned tunes from Weedeater, The Gates of Slumber (both coming to town on Thursday) Melvins and more.  That's 88.1 fm on yer radio, channel 947 on yer TV or [www.ckln.fm](http://www.ckln.fm) on yer computer!

Peace,

Greg
