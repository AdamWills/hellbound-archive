**By Keith Carman**

With their lumbering chug riffs offset by noodling guitars, thick, beastly breakdowns and overall combative attitude, Warbeast (previously known as Texas Metal Alliance) have an essence feeling very much like late-Pantera colliding with Superjoint Ritual. Strange that Phil Anselmo would produce them and put out the record then, isn't it?

Still, despite the obvious connections, with their chunky grind and relentless spirit, the band offers way more than this most transparent level. As _Krush The Enemy_ unfolds, it becomes clear that the band isn't influenced by Anselmo's past so much as vice versa. Pulling from singer Bruce Corbitt's history in seminal thrash metal brigade Rigor Mortis as well as the likes of Gammacide and Demonseed, there's a lot of formative history going on here.

Amusingly though, with so many fundamentals in one band, it's a mystery as to how the fuck these guys end up sounding like a less refined Gwar circa _America Must Be Destroyed_ colliding with late-model Exodus. Throw in a few half-time progressions reminiscent of S.O.D.'s best and that pretty much sums up the insular diversity of these ten tracks.

As confusing as it all is though, the only take-home point is that _Krush The Enemy_ doesn't just strive to be a part of the thrash metal resurgence. It's comprised of dudes who eat, sleep and shit so much thrash, their assholes are rusting. Loud, aggressive, overbearing, sincere and full of great shred, _Krush The Enemy is_ compelling from start to finish; a new high watermark in the ongoing saga of thrash.
