**By Keith Carman**

Psychedelic doom metal stalwarts Cathedral have always had a penchant for pushing boundaries. From the fact that they're a vastly diverse offshoot of grind gurus Napalm Death to their almost comedic tendencies on earlier works (we're talking “Midnight Mountain” here, folks) and general delight in mulling a particular groove to death, they know how to test patience while still being productive.

That said, even the most devout fan will most likely have to swallow ninth effort _The Guessing Game_ in smaller chunks than the Coventry-based quartet offers it up in. Modestly experimental and incredibly grandiose by their standards, this double album (their first ever) clocks in at an ungodly 80-plus minutes, way more than it should but, hey, it's Cathedral. You know the fuzz-pedals were particularly gritty one day and writing got out of hand.

Still, of _The Guessing Game's_ thirteen tracks, few truly drag on and only closer “Journeys Into Jade” dares pass the 10-minute mark so when it boils down—even if the band didn't bother to boil down much at all—one can't argue that it isn't a bold affair. From the slinking, majestic groove of “Painting In The Dark” through “Requiem For The Voiceless,” the quartet is spot-on with shuffling, borderline bluesy grooves and vocalist Lee Dorrian's inimitable vocals.

Which isn't to say the album isn't without its faults. Some tomfoolery and tinkering (synthesizers, strings and general noises/voices) should have been omitted as it does little to bolster the overall music and the band does manage to actually overstate their point/become boring during moments such as the droning out on “The Running Man.” Yet when placed in the context of these timelessly spacey tracks, _The Guessing Game_ does become a grower of an album that earns respect for the concepts it entertains—not always succeeds in delivering—but strives for nonetheless.
