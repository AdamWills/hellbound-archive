**By Victor Mansour**

For those who are not familiar with The Pineapple Thief, this UK band is classified as a crossover progressive rock band. The four piece band's most recent release is _3000 days_, which is a double CD compilation which collects tracks off of The Pineapple Thief's first few albums. Thief guitarist Bruce Soord, who is also chief songwriter, vocalist and occasional keyboardist, came from the band VULGAR UNICORN previously. This twenty-track double CD is well constructed. _3000 days_ covers many of the different styles of music throughout their recording career and a remarkable job was done remixing and remastering each track. “We Love You,” “ Clapham,” “Dead In The Water” and "Kid Chameleon” are just some of the great tracks. Much of the band's style in my opinion is focused on a Porcupine Tree–ish rhythm flow with a mixture of Pink Floyd feel to many of their tracks. In songs such as “The World I Always Dreamed Of,” “ Vapour Trails” and “ Snowdrops” the instrumental work is just amazing and the effects just blow you away. The finished product on this album, with the packaging put together with the artwork and remixed songs are, is well above average. I highly recommend you check this out as well as their 2003 full-length album Variations on a Dream. You will not be disappointed. Definitely recommended for fans of Porcupine Tree, Radiohead and Pink Floyd
