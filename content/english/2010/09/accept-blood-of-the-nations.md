**By Rob Kachluba**

There have been some great albums by veteran metal bands in 2010. First Overkill issued _Iron Bound_ and now German metal merchants Accept have released _Blood of the Nations_. These albums are the best works by both bands since their 80s heydays. Having recruited vocalist **Mark Tornillo** (ex-TT QUICK) you will have yourself saying Udo who? He is the perfect blend of Udo and Bon Scott but also adds his own identity. Helped by the fantastic production of Andy Sneap, you have the perfect combination of old school Accept with a modern touch. All their trademarks are here. Excellent riffs that are undeniably Accept in feel/tone, with those huge gang vocals and twin guitar attack will have you grinning from ear to ear. Opening track “Beat the Bastard Down” storms out of the gate in vintage Accept fashion followed by video single and infectious new classic "Teutonic Terror", followed by the darkness of “The Abyss”, which features a middle section where its just a piano and Mark singing in a quiet clean voice that really works well. The rest of the album really bodes well for the listener too. This is no one trick pony as these old Schoolers put many newbies to shame. Word has it they stole the show at this month’s Progpower fest in Atlanta; be sure to catch them next month on their small US tour with Kings X.
