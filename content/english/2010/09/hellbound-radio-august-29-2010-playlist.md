A pretty uneventful night around the Hellbound Hellhole last Sunday, aside from the usual flubs with the Wave Station (the computer program that sequences the on-air show and plays all the commercials we’re required to play) and Sean being in a rather bizarre mood. Though, we’ve discovered that time moves like the last day of school on a Sunday night when there are no computers to wile away the time when one would rather be listening to Envy or Saxon (for the 7 millionth time) with one ear.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
