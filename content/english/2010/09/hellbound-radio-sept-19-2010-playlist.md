Nothing to report this week, unless you consider three people fighting their way through sleepy head nods, micro sleep incidents and general unpreparedness to bring you your weekly dose of the shit that makes us headbang, reportable. No show next week as we’ll all be off being important in the various other aspects of our lives.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9-midnight EST on 101.5 FM, produced at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at [www.indifm.ca](http://www.indifm.ca)

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
