If you’ve ever been to the Hellbound Radio Catacombs, you’ll know that in the adjacent room, there’s a television that we often have on and angled towards us so that we can keep up with various sporting events as we deliver our weekly blast of metallic noise. Positions and responsibilities being what they are, Sean wouldn’t know this, but metal goes awesomely well with **Star Wars** on in the background.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
