[![eluveitie 2010](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/eluveitie-2010.jpg "eluveitie 2010")](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/eluveitie-2010.jpg) **By Jonathan Smith** _Everything Remains As It Never Was_ is the fourth album from Swiss folk metallers Eluveitie. Its title, considering the band's place in the growing mythology of folk and pagan metal, is suggestively profound. It's a shame, then, that the music on this new offering just isn't as enjoyable well as their previous work. _Slania_ (2008) was a fun (yet earnest-sounding) collection of energetic celtic death metal, and _Evocation 1_ (2009) was a enjoyable and progressive experiment in acoustic folk songs and a variety of singing voices (despite some of its vocal stereotypes). _Everything Remains As It Never Was_ simply doesn't equal these earlier two efforts.

As rousing as the epic bagpipe-filled opening instrumental, “Otherworld,” could be, its English voice-over sounds corny rather than mood-setting. The title track, even after repeated listens, is as silly-sounding as it is annoyingly catchy. Another issue is that the “beauty and the beast” interplay between the male and female vocals still come off as sounding tiresome. It's a feature that has become a grand stereotype in metal, and admittedly it's difficult to do right these days. Despite the downsides, there are some good moments to be found on _Everything Remains As It Never Was_. “Isara” is a great, mostly acoustic instrumental that invokes exactly the kind of vibe that a good folk metal musical interlude should. “Quoth The Raven” features a powerful chorus, as well as an all-too-brief moment of female growling. “The Liminal Passage” is an atmospheric ending track, invoking the vibe that was missing from “Otherworld.”

When _Evocation 1_ was released last summer, it was suggested that it was to be the first album in a two-part concept series. There is little evidence to suggest that _Everything Remains As It Never Was_ is the proper follow-up to that first part. It doesn't have the same sort of feel, and the majority of songs sound like filler material that wasn't included on _Slania_. Hopefully there is a companion album to Evocation 1still be produced in the near future. _While Everything Remains As It Never Was_ is not nearly as strong as its predecessors, one can hope that Eluveitie will soon return with an album that is deserving of their growing standing in their sub-genre.

Everything Remains As It Never Was will be released on March 9th, 2010.
