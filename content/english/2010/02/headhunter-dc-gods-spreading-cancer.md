A death metal band based in Salvador, Brazil, Headhunter D.C. has been on the map since 1989 although I personally had never heard of them before Hellbound editor Sean Palmerston suggested I should check them out. Knowing quite a bit South American bands, this one slipped through the cracks. This is the band's fourth full length studio album,  which is technically a three-year-old release that came out in Brazil in June, 2007, and it brings fifteen tracks packed with early Vader, Carcass and Possessed influences mixed with Dimmu Borgir style vocals (very throaty and rough aggressive roars). Headhunter D.C. is based on killer riffs, fast and angry tracks and Anti-Christian lyrics. _God's Spreading Cancer_ has no choppy riffs, no filler material, just extreme death metal from the starting track “Dysangelium (Intro)” and moves to a higher level right down to the last song (a cover track of Texas's Necrovore's “Slaughtered Remains”). _God's Spreading Cancer_'s title track has that double bass kick drum with chunky riffs, blistering leads with destructive energy. The highlight of the album however is “Abortion Of Souls.” The low growls of those death metal vocals just sound so unreal next to its rapid drumming with the blast beats. "Angelkiller” is another great one that features fast impressive shredding guitar solos from start to its finish, And to top it off on this solid album, a dash of three live tracks including “Death Vomit” and “Am I Crazy” which are both taken off their first release _Born...Suffer...Die_ released by Cogumelo Records in 1991. This album contains not a single bad song! If you are a “Deathbanger” and into aggressive old school Death Metal the way it should be done, then this is a top-notch album and a MUST for any true old school headbanger's collection. The bottom line is this is totally killer with absolutely no filler.
