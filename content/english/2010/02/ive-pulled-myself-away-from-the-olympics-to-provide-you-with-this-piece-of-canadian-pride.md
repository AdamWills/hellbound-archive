Alas, tis not a piece of [VANOC-unapproved poetry](http://www.geist.com/dispatch/praise-female-athletes-who-were-told-no) by Vancouver poet laureate [Brad Cran](http://bradcran.com/vancouver_verse/notes-on-a-world-class-city-why-i-have-declined-to-participate-in-the-olympic-celebrations/), but rather, a song from another B.C. artist that wouldn't be allowed within shouting distance of the Games: the Dayglo Abortions.

_I'm proud to be a Canadian Pass me another beer I'm proud to be a Canadian Hold my seat while i take a piss

Our prime minister sucks dogshit through his nose His ex-wife gets brown showers from Mick Jagger The only reason we live in fucking igloos Is our government makes a living licking shit holes

I'm proud to be a Canadian Pass me another welfare check I'm proud to be a Canadian Hold my seat while i go out and ca$h it

I'm proud to be a Canadian Pass me another eskimo I'm proud to be a Canadian Hold my seat while i fuck her up the ass hole_

Perhaps that wasn't particularly patriotic?

Oh, and who do ya like in the game tomorrow?  If Iginla's healthy, I'll take Canada, 3-2.

Peace,

Greg
