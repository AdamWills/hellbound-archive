**By Rob Kachluba**

Featuring former members of Earache recording artists White Wizzard, this Los Angeles five-piece play a feisty brand of NWOBHM with a speed metal slant. Improper Burial is their first release, a four song CD that features two originals and two somewhat pointless covers (Judas Priest's "Exciter" and "Fast as a Shark" by Accept. The two originals are decent enough: loads of shredding and wailing vocals, but the good thing is they know how to write a catchy song. Bottom line is this is fun metal played with over the top guitar shredding. It may be the Rye and Gingers in me, but I hear some Avenged Sevenfold in the guitar riffing/shredding and even some Hardcore Superstar due to the punky 80s riffs and similar vocal stylings. Don't let this be a deterrent though. Word has it there's a big push on for this band and they have recently signed to Prosthetic records, with a full length due out in April/May. Definitely a band to keep a look out for.
