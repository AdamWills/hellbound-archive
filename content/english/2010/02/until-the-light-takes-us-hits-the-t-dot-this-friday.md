Attention bangers, rockers, skids, black metal enthusiasts and inquisitive individuals alike: the world’s most unique film about black metal is making its long awaited arrival to Toronto!

I first discovered the trailer for this film very well over a year ago, and since then I have joined the street team – constantly putting a bug in director Audrey Ewell’s ear, persuading her and her co-director/producer Aaron Aites to bring this film to our cold, grim yet exciting city.

**Until The Light Takes Us** is not your conventional music doc. It’s not about the argument of which band started it all with their lo-fi production and corpsepaint, or the battle between definitive album releases, but it is a sheer and brilliant picture painted with storytelling, opinions and intricate thoughts that provoke great discussion.

It features Norwegian black metal eminence of Darkthrone’s witty Fenriz, 1349/Satyricon’s Frost, Immortal and Norway’s favourite arsonist/Burzum mainman Varg Vikernes, where they provide much insight on the music and murder involved in their homeland’s prime time for publicity.

I had the chance to see the film at the premiere of its theatrical release in New York last December and I cannot stress enough how enlightening and thought provoking the experience was.

If you are craving an exercise for your brain, if you love music, art, ideas and blasphemy, get your fill of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss in Toronto this week.
