As some of you know, I also run [TooHighToGetItRight.com](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/), a local stoner rock webzine.  Although I do more writing for Hellbound nowadays, I still have some THTGIR traditions, such as my annual Canadian Music Week recap, which I just posted about a week ago at [this location](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/reviews/concerts/cmw10.html).  There were some heavy sets by Harvey Milk and Bison B.C., along with some new musical discoveries, both Canadian and international.  Despite the shitty weather, I had a (pretty) good time.  I'll let you read about it if you so choose.

Speaking of Hellbound, if you subscribe to All That's Heavy/MeteorCity's mailing list, you'd have seen a quote from this site referencing Black Pyramid's self titled album, from a review written by yours truly.  Kinda bummed that they didn't mention my name, or provide a link (especially since they named the dude who reviewed 'em for stonerrock.com...), but hey, if it brings people over here, it's all good.  I'm gonna try to make the trip down to Buffalo to see BP in May, especially since local openers Chylde are supposedly [banned from Canada](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/reviews/concerts/march610.html) nowadays...

Oh, and here's a shocker for ya.  Apparently Nebula have [called it quits](http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2010/03/18/nebulabrokenupmaybe/).  While the band has yet to make an official announcement--the shows are still listed on their website and their [Myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/nebulamusic)\--woulda-been openers Quest For Fire just announced that [their tour's been called off](http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=223322444&blogId=531327894).  Local promoter Inertia Entertainment also lists the Toronto show on the 27 [as canceled](http://www.inertia-entertainment.com/main.html), so Ima hafta head down to Rotate This to get my money back...

In any case, you'll wanna take note that Nebula, Quest For Fire and Reverse Mount Rushmore will not be playing the Wreckroom next Sunday before anybody tries to sell ya a ticket...

Peace,

Greg

_P.S.: I'll still be spinning some Nebula on Smokin' Green tonite, which starts in about an hour.  Be sure to tune in at 1 am at 88.1 fm on yer radio, channel 947 on yer TV or [www.ckln.fm](http://www.ckln.fm) on yer computer!_
