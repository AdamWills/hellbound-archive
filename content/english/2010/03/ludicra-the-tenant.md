**By Laura Wiebe Taylor** I'm new to Ludicra. Bad timing kept me from even checking out their live show opening for Hammers of Misfortune last summer. _The Tenant_ has convinced me I've got some catching up to do. Sometimes described as a black metal band, Ludicra is far more than that. Yes, there are black metal elements but they're only one side of what might sound like a case of multiple personality disorder in less accomplished hands. If I didn't know Ludicra was a San Francisco band I might be able to guess - cross-collaborations and creative interaction in the scene have contributed to a particular atmosphere and array of sounds that are becoming distinctly recognizable. _The Tenant_ carries a lot of that vibe. Clear but distant, heavy but also sparse, the record conveys a live vitality that's usually hard to capture on disc. But it's also about genre-mixing, mining the past for something relevant to the present. Stripped-down blackened metal fuses with old school metal riffs, but the tech and progressive bits have an old school feel as well, all tempered with a vintage hint of grungey dark pop. And then it just stops - no resolution, no closure, and no direction where to go from here but into the band's back catalogue to see what I've missed.
