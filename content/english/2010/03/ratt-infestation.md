Back in the mid-80s, Ratt was one of the better metal/rock outfits that came out of the LA scene. Stephen Pearcy's distinct voice and the guitar tandem of Robbin Crosby and Warren DiMartini made some great 80s anthems such as "Wanted Man," "Lay it Down" and the huge video hit "Round and Round" Now in 2010 and newly signed to Roadunner, this five piece (including original members Bobby Blotzer, DiMartini and vocalist Steve Pearcy along with Former Quiet Riot guitar slinger Carlos Cavazo and bassist Bobby Crane) have released an 80s tinged melodic album that for the most part is quite good.

Opener "Eat Me Up Alive" sets the pace on high with a huge fast-paced riff opening the album and possibly the best song of the bunch. It has a really great verse to chorus transition with Pearcy sounding in fine form. It may be the heaviest song Ratt has ever penned. Next up is the cheeseball "Best of Me" which has a huge 80s vibe with a mid-paced simple riff and almost unbearable chorus. One wonders why they follow up such a strong song with such a weak second track, but things thankfully get back on track with "A Little Too Much" which features another great chugging riff. For the most part the faster numbers seem to work better and come across more sincere then the almost average sounding mid-pace affairs in "Look Out Below," "As Good As It Gets" and "Best of Me." I wasn't expecting much from this album but am mildly impressed with a lot of the songwriting - full of huge hooks, great guitar work and of course Pearcy's voice. Ratt brings back the classic sound of the 80s with great songwriting and great guitar solos but still for the most part inject some modern toughness to it. Now if they could just lose some of those cheeseball songs this would of been an absolute monster of an album.
