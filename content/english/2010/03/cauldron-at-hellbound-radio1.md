On Sunday, February 28th, Hellbound Radio was delighted to have some special guests in the studio. **Jason Decay** and **Ian Chains** make up two-thirds of Toronto metal trio **Cauldron** and they made the trip down the QEW to Hamilton and hung with us in the INDI 101 studios, so we in turn dedicated a huge chunk of the three hour show to their band.

We spent the better part of 180 minutes talking about the history of the band, signing to the Earache Records label and touring non-stop, as well as playing music from their Earache debut _**Chained To The Nite**_, plus a song off their first indie release _**Into The Cauldron**_. On top of that, Ian from the band brought in some of his favourite early eighties metal jams and we rocked some of those too.

With the band heading out on tour in Eastern Canada this week, we thought weâ€™d make some video available from the radio show this past Sunday. Here is the first part of the interview.

The band is interviewed in this segment by **Kevin Stewart-Panko** and **Sean Palmerston**, while the video footage was filmed by **Albert Mansour** and **Adam Wills**. All editing and production on the video was done by **Adam Wills**.
