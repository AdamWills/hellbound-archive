**By Rob Kachluba**

German melodic death metallers Dark Age's sixth album _Acedia_ is a bit of a departure from their previous efforts, but that is no reason to be frightened away from checking it out. While it is a bit more accessible than previous efforts, I am happy to report they still retained their dark edge and thankfully haven't gone all syrupyala Soilwork. The album is full of huge choruses, bouncy, thrashy melodic riffs, and a massive sound is the name of the game here.There is quite a lot of mid-paced riffing with some great electronica but it is done very lightly in the same vein as earlier Raunchy. They do step on the gas now and then as well and to be honest that is where the Soilwork comparisons may come up. A very solid mature release that should garner them some attention, _Acedia_ is chock full of very well written songs that are smartly paced and demand repeat listens.
