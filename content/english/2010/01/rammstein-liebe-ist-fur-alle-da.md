Probably their best album since _Mutter_, these crazed Germans storm back with a riff-infested grinding metal attack. The first three tracks speak for themselves. Great heavy riffing with those golden choruses and the MASSIVE production makes this a very enjoyable album to crank on my big system. I am not usually a fan of this kind of stuff but when its written this well and sounds this good it is hard to ignore. The key, as always, to Rammstein's success is the repetitive hypnotic riffing and huge choruses which were lacking for the most part on their last few offerings but are up front on most tracks. They have their standard radio single in "Pussy" which is a really nifty hooky number that is sung partially in English.The video contains graphic scenes of male and female nudity, as well as women engaging in sexual activity with the band members. It is one of the most extreme videos you will ever see from a mainstream band.
