**By Jonathan Smith**

From the comic book occult artwork on the covers to the promotional photos of the band in full spiky regalia, the old-school vibe that Swedish black metallers Nifelheim have exhibited since the mid-nineties is found on these re-releases in its roughest forms. With a sound rooted more in earlier bands like Bathory and Venom rather than later Norwegian cuts, both _Nifelheim_ and _Devil's Force_ are blasts of thrashy black metal that stick to a plan and rarely deviate. Compared back to back, stand-out riffs like those found in songs such as “Sodomizer” and the added cover of Bathory's “Die In Fire” mean that the debut holds up better than _Devil's Force_. A welcome feature is the fact that both CD inserts retain the “Side A” and “Side B” track listings from the original records. This arrangement makes it easier to get a sense of the albums' original flow. The inserts are also worth a browse. They contain recording information, write-ups from Metalion of _Slayer_ magazine, and a variety of promotional and behind-the-scenes photos. Whether it's time to restock your collection or you're just discovering Nifelheim for the first time, both the debut and _Devil's Force_ contain the original goods plus just enough little “metal geek” extras to make you consider taking the trip back in time.
