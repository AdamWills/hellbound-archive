**CONTEST CLOSED. WINNER WILL BE CONTACTED**

Let's get 2010 underway with a bang! What better way to get your year off to a good start than with a contest. To help celebrate the end of 2009 and the beginning of both a new year and a new decade, we've asked some of our favourite labels to help us welcome 2010 and what a bang it is!

One contest winner is going to receive nearly 50 CDs from bands on the AFM, Century Media, E1 Records Canada, Ibex Moon, Metal Blade, Nuclear Blast, Prosthetic, Relapse, Roadrunner, Season Of Mist, Sensory and Sonic Unyon labels. This includes autographed CDs from AUGURY, BLACK DAHLIA MURDER, JOB FOR A COWBOY, PORCUPINE TREE,  SACRIFICE, TESTAMENT and VOIVOD, a Prosthetic Records t-shirt (either L or XL), a CRADLE OF FILTH picture disc 7" and some more stuff TBA (we're not gonna list everything until it arrives).
