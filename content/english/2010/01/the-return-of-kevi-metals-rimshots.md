Those of you who were disciples to Adrian Bromley’s _Unrestrained!_ are well familiar with Rimshots. Those of you who read _Decibel_ (and there’s absolutely no reason not to!) may have noticed a similar, digital-age inspired endeavour entitled ‘Tweets for Twats.’ Those of you old enough to remember will notice how I ripped this idea off from Ron Quintana’s ‘Ron’s Retarded Record Reviews’. What happens is that I review new releases using two or three sentences max. Act like a wiseass and, sometimes, hilarity ensues. This will only appear when I’m motivated enough or Sean threatens parking sanctions against me.

And a-way we go…

AVULSED NULLO (THE PLEASURE OF SELF-MUTILATION) IBEX MOON Fenriz will love it (“Voracious Backpacker”), your crotchety gramps will sympathize (“Infernal Haemorrhoids pt.2”) as will that quiet, unassuming library worker next door (“She’s Hot Tonight (In My Oven)).” Come for the riffs, stay for the bunghole-bursting, chick slaughtering mayhem! \[8/10\]

SLAYER WORLD PAINTED BLOOD SONY/AMERICAN

No matter how senselessly screamy the solos get, how recycled the riffs get and how many times Lombardo quits, it’s always been Tom Araya that delivers the most frenetic performance, even while seeming totally disinterested. This band is fucked! \[7/10\]
