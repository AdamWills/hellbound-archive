**By Ola Mazzuca**

Pestilential, meaning ‘plague like’ or contagious, has to be the most fitting description for a band that brings infectious darkness. Who knew kangaroo loving, koala bear petting Australia could spawn cold, monarchical and obscure black metal? With a sound strongly reminiscent of Emperor’s _Wrath of the Tyrant_ and low-fi musicianship of the early black metal scene, Pestilential Shadows prove that their third full-length release is a reasonable listen.

Considering black metal has quite a few, I believe that every musical sub-genre can bring forth various elements. PS is not gearing towards the pummeling, chaotic brutality of never ending blast beats and blistering guitar solos, but more towards a gloomy, drone tone paired with a relaxed tempo, heavily showcased on “Beautiful Demise”.

The album is so ambient that it puts you in quite the mindset. “With Serpents I Lay” really defines _In Memoriam, Ill Omen_ displaying the true character of Pestilential Shadows, featuring an interlude of nearly nothing to catch up to a simple percussion pattern and classic screech vocals.

Although Pestilential Shadows do not consistently go to extremes with uber fast tempos and virtuoso techniques, I wouldn’t call them boring. You wouldn’t expect music on _In Memoriam, Ill Omen_ to be created by four Australian dudes, ‘cause compared to the bright sun and hot climate they thrive in, there is no shortage of dusk on this album.

Rating: 6.5
