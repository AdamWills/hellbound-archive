You've been asking us by email, twitter, even a few people have called me on the phone to find out who won our big year end contest . Well, here is the information you've all been waiting for.

Congratulations to **Natalie Walschots** of Toronto, ON, who won the big haul of 50 CDs, 2 7"s, 5 autographed posters, 1 OBSCURA longsleeve shirt, 1 Prosthetic Records tshirt, a DAGOBA dog chain, a Season Of Mist canvas bag and various stickers, etc.

On Saturday evening Albert Mansour , my son Kieran and I went to Toronto and delivered Natalie her contest winnings in person and she was kind enough to pose for some pictures with her winnings and young Master Kieran:
