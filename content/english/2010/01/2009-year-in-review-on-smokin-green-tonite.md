A little FYI for ya:  I'll be ringing in the New Year on CKLN tonite with my Top 10 albums of 2009.  Expect to hear music from Ogre, Black Pyramid, Sons of OTIS, Candlemass, and more.  You can tune in at 1 am at 88.1 fm on yer radio, channel 947 on yer Rogers TV or [www.ckln.fm](http://www.ckln.fm) on yer computer.

By the way, I've also posted my Top 10 albums and concerts of the year over on THTGIR.  [Check 'em out](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/2009top10.html)!
