If I could point out one negative aspect of metal today, it is that fresh elements are strongly lacking, which leaves us always looking for a new and intriguing listen.

Hailing from Portugal, it may come as a surprise to know that Ava Inferi features one of black metal’s best: former Mayhem guitarist Blasphemer. Don’t expect _Blood Of Bacchus_ to sound anything like _Grand Declaration of War_, because the two are simply incomparable.

The album is gothic to a great degree, which shines through on “Last Sign of Summer” and “Colours of the Dark”. However dark, all of the tracks are strongly supported by Carmen Susana Simões’ light, harmonious vocals that express great passion on the chant-like “Black Wings”. The extensive sounds of “Appeler Les Loups” shapes the album; showcasing all thematic and musical elements in just over nine minutes while the instrumental “Memoirs” leaves a very lasting impression of Ava Inferi’s nostalgia inducing metal.

_Blood Of Bacchus_ is haunting and mysterious. It is graceful and desolate. Picture pure doom, lying under soft, almost operatic vocals and heavy guitars. Though it is very easy to develop a strong sense of what Ava Inferi sound like through this description, you will never fully understand the brilliance of this band until you give them a fervent listen.
