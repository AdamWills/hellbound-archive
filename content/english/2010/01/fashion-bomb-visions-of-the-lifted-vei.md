**By Melissa Andrews**

“Visions of the Lifted Veil” is the sophomore album from Fashion Bomb. The cover art displays the band looking water-drowned gothic in front of a rainy post apocalyptic Chicago background. Their sound isn’t very gothic sounding. The closest they really get is some of the guitar sounds remind me a lot of Marilyn Manson.

The songs are fairly generic run of the mill radio friendly metal. I imagine that they would go well with a nice glossy video. Saying that they do a decent job of writing radio friendly tunes and the production work and recording quality are well done. The vocals are strongest instrument of the album. There are a variety of vocal styles from power singing, shouting to a bit of growling and they are all decently executed.

The album contains a cover of Tori Amos’s Crucify. The song is instantly recognizable but the version is different enough that it’s actually interesting. The style doesn’t go with anything else on the album, as it would stick out even if it weren’t a cover. Of the rest of the songs “The Stalker” is the song most worth mentioning. It sounds like a single and even though it’s not exceptionally original, I wouldn’t change the radio station if it came on. The album’s not a complete bomb but it’s still meh.
