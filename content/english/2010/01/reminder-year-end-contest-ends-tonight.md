Just a little reminder to anyone that hasn't voted that today (Friday, January 15th) is your LAST CHANCE to enter our bitchin' year end contest. You have until midnight Eastern Standard Time tonight to win our fantastic prize, which has now grown to 50 CDs (many of them autographed), two (2) 7"s, two (2) shirts, three (3) autographed posters, a dog tag and a few more goodies too.

Since we started the contest on January 1st, we've had a few more packages show up for the contest from our friends at E1 Music Canada and the always awesome Relapse Records posse. Take a look below to see what's been added to the haul that's up for grabs:
