Today is the first anniversary of the launch of HELLBOUND.CA! One year ago the site went live for the first time with a small staff of excellent, dedicated writers and hopeful plans that we'd be able to stick it out. Now twelve months later we are still here with a cracking staff of writers, a pretty sizeable archive of reviews, interviews and features and a growing readership of some of the most fervent metal fans on the planet.

Thank you to everyone that has contributed to our site, either as a writer, a reader or as someone who has helped us arrange interviews, get into live shows, sent us CDs for review or given us advice/criticism on the site.  Not only do you enable us to do what we do, you also help make Hellbound.ca better.
