I am sure by now you all have heard about how "the Big Four" are finally playing together this summer, albeit only in Europe at massive summer festivals. Well, if you live in Canada and can't make it overseas this summer, maybe a trip to your local movie theatre will suffice? Read below to find out about a very cool special event (and how you can enter to win passes too)...

On Tuesday, June 22nd, “The Big Four” - **METALLICA, SLAYER, MEGADETH** and **ANTHRAX** - are bringing their historic European tour to the global stage with a concert shown via satellite in High-Definition (HD) in **Cineplex Entertainment theatres** across Canada. Despite huge demand, these musical giants have never shared the same stage until now. The legendary concert from the tour’s stop at the Sonisphere Festival in Sofia, Bulgaria will air at more than 65 Cineplex theatres across the country. Watch the trailer here: [http://www.byexperience.net/event\_thebigfourlive.html](http://www.byexperience.net/event_thebigfourlive.html)

Advance tickets are available now online at [www.cineplex.com/events](www.cineplex.com/events ) as well as at participating theatre box offices. General admission is $18.00. OR GO TO THE BOTTOM TO FIND OUT HOW YOU CAN WIN A PAIR OF FREE PASSES!

In December 2009, the bands announced that they would be joining forces to take part in the traveling Sonisphere Festival for only seven shows across Europe. Now, this one-time only event from the Sofia show makes it possible for fans far and wide to participate in what otherwise is a very limited run of dates. The HD concert presentation will memorialize the event and the impact will be amplified globally with the cinema screenings, making the dreams of fans around the world over become a reality.

**Lars Ulrich** of Metallica says of this historic announcement, "Who would have thought that more than 25 years after its inception, thrash metal's Big Four would not only still be around, be more popular than ever, playing shows together at stadiums all over Europe, and on top of that, coming to a movie theatre near you in High Definition (for better or worse??!!). Bring it on!"

Anthrax guitarist **Scott Ian** says “Damn, as if this Big Four tour wasn't exciting enough now we get to be on the big screen worldwide! Metal at the movies, two big horns up! It is unbelievably gratifying that this means so much to the metal community around the globe. Get your tix, grab some popcorn and get ready to bang your head!”

Declares Slayer’s **Kerry King**, “I can’t believe someone didn’t make this happen 15 years ago! The fans finally get what they want. I think it’s awesome!”

Says Megadeth’s **Dave Mustaine**, “The magnitude of this event hasn't really sunk in yet, and I am thrilled to know that people around the planet will be able to walk into a movie theatre and experience the greatest line up of Heavy Metal in the history of the world!”
