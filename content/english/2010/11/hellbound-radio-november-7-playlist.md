Zzzzz…. If we had a closed-circuit camera or something running in the booth during this weeks’ edition, you would have paid witness to three of the most comatose motherfuckers on the planet trying to play metal for… well, we know there’s one dude listening, but other than him, we have no clue. I nodded off during a song from one of my favourite albums of the year, but Sean took the cake for falling asleep while typing whatever ever he was typing into the computer on the other side of the board. Extra hour of sleep my black ass!

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on INDI 101, broadcasting from Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca
