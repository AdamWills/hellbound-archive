During this week’s show, I stumbled across the online discography of Swedish all-female thrash band **Ice Age** and figured out how to play material loaded on one of the station’s computers on air. Back in the late 80s I used to love this friggin’ band, but the ravages of time being what they are, wasn’t sure how well their material had aged. I tell you what, four green women from Sweden banging it out some 22 years ago can still out-thrash the vast majority of what knots people’s panties these days. However, I’m gonna guess the inevitable reunion – because, in case you haven’t noticed, no band stays broken up forever – will likely tarnish the good name they built for themselves in my rose coloured world. But at least I know if Hellbound ever needs a tinny, demo-quality thrash injection in the future, we know where to go.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
