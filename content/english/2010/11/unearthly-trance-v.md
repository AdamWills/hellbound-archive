**By Gruesome Greg**

After putting out a fistful of splits last year, NYC's **Unearthly Trance** have returned with their fifth full-length effort. A slow, sludgy, sixty-minute slog, _V_ occasionally veers into Neur-Isis territory and has its dalliances with drone doom, but mostly mimics the sounds of **YOB**—minus of course the trademark wails of Mike Scheidt. UT screamer **Ryan Lipynsky** occasionally channels the tortured screams of Kirk Windstein and the droning moans of Al Cisneros, but more commonly employs a standard black/death metal bark.

Replace the guitar with bass on “Adversaries Mask 1” and you've got something that you might find on OM's latest uninspired offering. “Adversaries Mask 2” is hardly a barn-burner, either. “Physical Universe Distorts” follows the simple interchanging pattern of belched-lyric/ two-note riff, lather, rinse, repeat, but is too short to be overly repetitive. There isn't much in the way of standout tracks on this one, but rather a continuous, pummelling, ear-pounding assault that only seems to get slower as the album nears its conclusion.

If you like the slow shit, _V_ is somewhat satisfying, but it's only earth-shattering if you play it loud.
