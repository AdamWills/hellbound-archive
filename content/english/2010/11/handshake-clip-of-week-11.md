With the recent announcement that legendary Canadian metal quartet VOIVOD will be one of the headline bands at the 2011 edition of the Maryland Death Fest, we thought what better way to celebrate that by posting an interview segment with original VOIVOD bassist Blacky. He was there in 2010 as sound man for GORGUTS, but ended up also doing sound for PORTAL and DECEASED, amongst others. This clip was filmed outside and features Blacky along with GORGUTS/ DYSRHYTHMIA guitarist Kevin Hufnagel speaking a little bit about both bands.

Say, wouldn't that make for a killer prog metal tour: VOIVOD with GORGUTS and DYSRHYTHMIA? OK, onto the clip...
