This edition of Hellbound Radio saw the return of former co-host, Hellbound.ca contributor and Dying Fetus’ biggest (in more ways than one) fan, Matt Lewis, or, as we like to call him, "Hugo". He was pimping a fest he’s putting on here in Hamilton called Afterburner Fest and we can only hope that the response come the night of the show is more enthusiastic than the response we had in trying to give away tickets. Otherwise, it was a jolly reunion of sorts that included more on-air chatter than usual, hence the seemingly limited playlist. That, and we lost the half-hour of the list because Sean was too busy not being harassed by Jay Gorania on Facebook.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on 101.5 Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at [www.indifm.ca](http://www.indifm.ca)

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
