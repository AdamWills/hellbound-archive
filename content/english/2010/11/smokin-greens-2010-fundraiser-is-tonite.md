It all goes down tonite, folks. If you\`re sitting on the fence, scratching your head, going "Shouldn\`t radio be free?" consider this. Unlike commercial radio, CKLN doesn\`t bombard you with advertisements. We firmly believe in less talk, more rock. (Well okay, there are some talk shows in the daytime, but that\`s beside the point...)

Where else are you gonna hear the stoner, psych, sludge and doom metal that Smokin\` Green provides on a weekly basis? Not on commercial radio, that\`s for sure. Check out my [past playlists](http://toohightogetitright.darkbb.com/smokin-green-f17/), if you haven\`t already, to see what kinda music I play.

Not only am I spreading doom all over the Greater Toronto Area, but worldwide via live streaming on [CKLN.fm](http://www.ckln.fm/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=150&Itemid=205) and by posting past episodes online on [TooHighToGetItRight](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/smokingreen.html). So, even if you\`re not in Toronto, I could use your support.

Now, typically the station wants you to make a 50 dollar donation--at least, that\`s how much you gotta pay to get some CKLN swag. But I know that 50 bucks is a lot, so I\`m willing to reward smaller donations, because any amount helps. I\`ve still got five THTGIR T-Shirts (as seen [here](http://toohightogetitright.com/shirtpic.jpg)) to give away, and if you pledge 25 dollars, I\`ll send one your way. I don\`t care where you live, I\`ll still ship it to ya.

Even if you can only give 10 bucks, I\`ll gladly take it. I\`ll even play a song for ya on the program. Drop me a line at [gruesomegreg@toohightogetitright.com](mailto:gruesomegreg@toohightogetitright.com) -- if I don\`t have it on me tonite, I\`ll be sure to bring whatcha wanna hear for a future episode. Any amount helps; if you donate 20 dollars, I\`ll play two songs for ya, 30 for three songs, and so on...

Again, there are two ways to donate. You can either call the number that I provide on the air tonite, or donate by clicking on the PayPal button [at this location](http://ckln.fm/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=51&Itemid=86).

**PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MUST PUT "DONATION TO SMOKIN\` GREEN" IN THE DESCRIPTION FIELD OF THE PAYPAL FORM!** Sorry for shouting, but I can\`t stress this enough. This must be done for your donation to be credited to Smokin\` Green. And if you do donate via Paypal, [drop me a line](mailto:gruesomegreg@toohightogetitright.com) with confirmation of payment (you should get an email) so I can send you a shirt and/or play some songs for ya.

My show airs from 1 till 3 am Eastern Time, and you can tune in at 88.1 fm on yer radio, channel 947 on yer Rogers digital cable box or [www.ckln.fm](http://www.ckln.fm/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=150&Itemid=205) on yer computer. If you don\`t get around to reading this until Sunday, Monday, or whenever, you can still donate online via PayPal. Just be sure to put DONATION TO SMOKIN\` GREEN in the description field, and I\`ll play your request(s) when I\`m back on the air in December.

Please give generously... Keep the Sabbath Dream Alive!

Peace,

Greg
