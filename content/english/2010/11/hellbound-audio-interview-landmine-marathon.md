Kevin Stewart-Panko and Sean Palmerston sat down with the members of Landmine Marathon when they played at Hamilton's Club Absinthe last Thursday night. The show was part of their current tour with label mates Withered and Skeletonwitch. Topics discussed include touring in cold weather, what is it like to be part of a package tour and their new limited edition cassette boxed set (!!!) of all three of their albums.

Recorded in the basement of Club Absinthe with a hand-held SanDisk Sansa

Landmine Marathon's latest album _Sovereign Descent_ is out now on Prosthetic Records.
