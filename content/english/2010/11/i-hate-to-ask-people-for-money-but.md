There comes a time every year when I must do so: CKLN's Fundfest.  For those who don't know, a decent chunk of the station's budget comes from the Ryerson student body, but we rely pretty heavily on listener donations as well.

And we haven't had any listener donations in a while.  The station was off the air entirely for seven months, and we're still in the restoration process barely a year later.  Any money we wouldda raised in Fundfest '08 is long gone by now...

Last time I had to raise funds, I put on a [benefit concert](http://toohightogetitright.darkbb.com/416-shows-f8/the-second-sunday-stoner-rock-spectacular-sons-of-otis-nadja-diablo-red-the-harold-wartooth-el-mocambo-september-28th-t62.htm).  I was fortunate that the El Mocambo felt they owed me a favour (and a free booking) and from there, the pieces seemed to fall into place.  I'm pretty sure it's the only time that OTIS and Nadja have ever shared the stage, and that likely won't change, what with the latter living in Europe nowadays...

But this year, I don't have the means, nor the time to put together such a gathering.  So I am counting on my listeners and my readership to Keep the Sabbath Dream Alive.  Next weekend, I'll be going on air to ask for money in support of Smokin' Green.  Here's how it works:  Donate to my program and I'll play any song you want, 10$ per request.   We can do this in increments, ie gimme 20, and I'll play two songs fer ya.  (If I don't have what you wanna hear with me, I'll play it for ya in December when I'm back on the air...)

I also have a (VERY) limited number of Too High To Get It Right T-Shirts that look like this:

There are two ways to donate, either by calling in to my show next week or donating online, where  CKLN has set up a [donations page](http://ckln.fm/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=51&Itemid=86) so you can contribute via PayPal.  You'll hafta put DONATION TO SMOKIN' GREEN in the Description field to have it credited to my show.  (If you click the PayPal button, you'll see what I mean.)  I've been told that a new version of the CKLN website will be launching next week with further online donation options, so I'll keep y'all posted on that.

In the meantime, if you do decide to donate via PayPal, send me a proof of payment with your request(s) and shirt size (if applicable) to [this email address](mailto:gruesomegreg@toohightogetitright.com) and I'll do my best to get 'em on the air next week.

If you can kick in a couple bucks to keep Smokin' Green on the air and Keep the Sabbath Dream Alive, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Peace,

Greg
