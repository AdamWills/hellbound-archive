## Ten Lessons Learned from Extreme Metal, Outlaw Country, and the Power of Self-Determination

### By David Vincent with Joel McIver

#### Published by Jawbone Press

While Morbid Angel fans will find much to enjoy with ‘I Am Morbid’; there is much more to this book that a standard musician autobiography, herein you will find David’s hard-won wisdom. You won’t necessarily share his ideas about everything but if you approach them with an open mind there is gold to be gleaned.

For instance, his comments about the lack of foresight and planning people put into their lives is right on the money, in the 21st century the average person can’t grow their own food, which is part of a general dangerous overdependence on others that has been fostered in the 21st century. The more dependent we are, we more products we buy, and that’s what so much of modern life is about.

Overall, while the tales of David’s life in music are entertaining, it’s his ideas that count, I could see a future for him giving motivational talks as well as in music.

Kudos to the legend that is Joel McIver for helping create a fine book.

Overall, recommended to an audience beyond the typical music book.
