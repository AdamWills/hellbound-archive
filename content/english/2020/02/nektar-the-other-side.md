It’s a great achievement for a legendary band to come back with an album this good, after all, a classic band is often in competition with its own youthful back catalogue.

No such worries here, the songs brim with freshness and sincerity, while Nektar’s musicianship and song-writing skill, like fine wine, have only improved with age.

Excellent, for old and new Nektar fans alike.
