Nick Oliveri and company are back with their first new album in eight years. Now featuring former members of Nebula and John Garcia’s Band of Gold, **Mondo Generator** packs 14 tracks into 43+ minutes on this double-middle-finger-adorned record.

Opening salvo “Nowhere Man” opens with a pretty decent desert-rock groove, though it picks up the pace to a mid-tempo shuffle beneath Oliveri’s punk-rock barking vocals. “Up Against the Void” is up-tempo from the get go, a frantic, two-minute hardcore number akin to Bl’ast! And speaking of Kyuss, Nick formally puts his former band to bed with the _Blues for the Red Sun_ grooves of “Kyuss Dies!” by repeating the song title some 20-odd times in its final minute.

Following the Zeke-style party rock anthem “Turboner,” the title track reminds me more of latter-day Orange Goblin…until it breaks for a Queen-style stomp-stomp-clap section around the 1:10 mark. Uh, what the fuck?

Sandwiched between several fast-paced, punk-rocking tunes, instrumental “Silver Tequila: 666 Miles Away” is sort of a strung-out stoner-rock version of The Champs classic for its first two minutes, with the only lyrics being “Silver… Tequila!” But it then takes on a more typical song structure, sounding more like something offa _Cocaine Rodeo_. The creepy, crawling “Option Four” is also somewhat along the lines of “Shawnette Jackson,” except it’s a mainly spoken-word vocal about such topics as getting high and suicide by cop. In other words, more or less what we might expect from Nick Oliveri.
