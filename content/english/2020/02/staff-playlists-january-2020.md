Another round of recommendations from some of the folks at Hellbound.

* * *

## Steve Earles

**Non-metal:** Nektar - _The Other Side_

**Wild Card:** _The Avengers_ – not the comic book, the 60s series with Diana Rigg. What's not to like?

## Gruesome Greg

**Listening to:** Lowrider - _Ode to Io_

**New release:** Lowrider - _Refractions_

**Live:** Church of Misery, Black Wizard, Forming the Void @ The Garrison, Feb 18

**Non-Metal:** The Cranberries - _Zombie_

**Wild card:** Chiefs over Niners in the Super Bowl. San Fran's offence ain't nothing but a Jimmy G thang...

\[editor's note: Greg made this pick _before_ Super Bowl weekend\]

## Sarah Riley

**Listening to:** Windhand - _Grief's Infernal Flower_ (Relapse Records, 2015). I came to the realization the other day that I've listened to this band on a daily basis for the past, at minimum, two years.

**New release:** Ritual in Ruin - _Of Myth and Slander_ (Nomadic Arts, January 20th, 2020)

**Live:** Brand Of Sacrifice, Signs Of The Swarm, Inferi, Shadow Of Intent @ Hard Luck Bar, Toronto, January 31st.

**Non-Metal:**  Lynyrd Skynyrd - _I Need You_ (Second Helping, Sounds of the South, 1974)

**Wild card:** Chicken Parmesan on a Waffle from Cluck Clucks in Toronto, absolute insanity.

## Laura Wiebe

**Listening to:** Jolly - _Family_

**New release:** Aerial Ruin/Panopticon – Split

**Non-Metal (that feels like metal):** Raphael Weinroth-Browne - _Worlds Within_

**Wild card:** I'm pretty old to be visiting the Hockey Hall of Fame for the first time, but I just did. I'm now super interested in learning everything I can about [Angela James](https://www.hhof.com/htmlInduct/ind10James.shtml).
