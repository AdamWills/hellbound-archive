## February 23, 2020 at The City National Grove, Anaheim CA

Three years ago Christian rock/metal band Skillet came to the Grove of Anaheim. That was the very first time I ever saw them as a guest. They were joined by bands like Sick Puppies and Devour by the Day. This Show was really spectacular that I told myself “the next time I see Skillet I’m going to be over that barricade photographing them”. Tonight I got to do just that, I was excited to be living out my dream and checking this off of my bucket list. This Time Skillet was joined on tour with Jen Ledger who debuted her very first solo rock project called Ledger for Anaheim. She is also the drummer and co vocalist for Skillet. They were also Joined by From Ashes To New.

First act to kick off the show was [**Ledger**](https://www.ledgerband.com/). Fans were excited to finally see her solo music live for the first time. She and band mate Korey Cooper began to write music for her solo project album in 2012. In March 2018, Ledger was produced by Korey Cooper along with writer and producer Seth Moseley. She played songs from her latest EP and some of her newest releases. She played ICONIC, RAMPAGE, WARRIOR, which was my personal favorite song from the night, GONER, MY ARMS, COSMIC, and ended her set with, NOT DEAD YET. Ledger was a joy to see on stage. She interacted with as many fans as she could with waves and smiles during her performance. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for her amazing talent.

Following up that amazing performance is a band that I had yet to see live. [**From Ashes To New**](https://www.fromashestonew.com/), a band formed in 2013, from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. This band consists of members clean vocals, unclean vocals, Danny Case, vocals, rap vocals, keyboard, rhythm guitar; Matt Brandyberry, lead guitar; Lance Dowdle, and drummer; Mat Madiro. Their band can be described as rap metal, and alternative metal. This band put on an amazing set, and each of the members kept their energy up interacting with the crowd as well as the photographers. Guitarist Lance was just dominating the stage with high jumps and kicks everywhere. I will definitely be looking forward to another one of their shows in the future.

Last but not least the headliners, [**Skillet**](https://www.skillet.com). It’s been a long while since I’ve seen them, so I was more than excited to see the spectacular performance that they always put on. Skillet is an American Christian rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1996. The band currently consists of husband John; lead vocals, bass, wife Korey Cooper; rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals, along with Jen Ledger; drums, vocals and Seth Morrison; lead guitar. Each lyric, riff, and beat causes a powerful force that helps save lives. John and all the bands in this line up expressed their awareness for mental health and how music played a big part of their lives. A lot of classics were played like old and new, FEEL INVINCIBLE, NOT GONNA DIE, YOU AIN’T READY. During their song YOU AIN’T READY John fired 2 guns with dried ice air into the crowd. They then continued with WHISPERS IN THE DARK, LEGENDARY, AWAKE AND ALIVE, BACK FROM THE DEAD, SAVE ME, HERO, ANCHOR, SAVIOR, UNDEFEATED, VICTORIOUS, STARS, CAMATOSE, MONSTER, REBIRTHING and closed out the show with THE RESISTANCE. In the end, victorious lived up to its name and Skillet played one hell of a show.
