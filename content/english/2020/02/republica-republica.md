Back in 1996, ‘Ready To Go’ was the happy high-energy soundtrack to many people’s lives. Great song as it is, the parent self-titled album is superb.

Fronted by the lovely Saffron, who had previously rocked the catsuit in N-joi (there’s a band who deserve a curated collection of their music!), the band were riding the spirit of the age (this was the time of The Prodigy, and mixing music and electronics was in the air).

This 3CD collection is awesome (fabulous remixes!), as are the sleeve notes from Saffron herself. Really, I cannot recommend it enough. A superb collection from a truly innovative band whose best work is still in front of them.
