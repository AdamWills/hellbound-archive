_Self-Control_ was one of the defining hits of the 80s, and is a fine pop song in any era. But, the album that featured it is worthy in its own right, and well worth assessing on it’s own merits.

The real attraction here, beyond the original album, is an extra additional CD of rare tracks, re-mixes and so forth.

It’s a fine legacy for a talented artist who died far too young.
