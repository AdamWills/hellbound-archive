I was watching an episode of _Cities of the Underworld_ yesterday evening, set in (or to be more accurate-under) San Francisco. It made me think of how the environment they developed in must have had a profound effect on _The Residents._

But, _The Residents_ are actually refugees from the South, and this too must have had an effect on their musical DNA. Though subconsciously, as they did not retain much contact with their former stomping ground.

 On a recent visit home, the band met an old friend Roland Sheehan, who introduced _The Residents_ to the music of a certain Alvin Snow, known as Dyin’ Dog! Alvin was an albino, born into a multi-racial family, _The Residents_ became fascinated with his work, and oversaw a box set of Dyin’ Dog’s original 70s demo.

As fans of _The Residents,_ will know the next step was for them to do an album of covers of Dyin’ Dog. I love their versions, but what’s extra special about this release is disc 2; the original Dyin’ Dog demos so the listener can compare versions. I love them both, _T__he Residents_ make the songs in their own identity but retain what makes them special in the demos.

A wonderful, uplifting and unique collection!
