This is an important release that covers the punk and post-punk music scene of Northern Ireland in the years between 1977 and 1984. This was very much the time of _The Troubles_ in Northern Ireland, and the music here reflects that. It was produced in an often dangerous time, it reflects those times, and for that reason alone is an important historical item; kudos to Cherry Red Records for this.

 But, it goes beyond history. The music inside this beautifully presented hardback book is three CDs of simply great music, still crackling with a vibe, sincerity and energy that puts what passes for pop music today for shame. This isn’t music to simply idly download like so much music today, this is music that matter and deserves to be treated as such.

Absolutely essential for anyone who **_truly_** loves music.
