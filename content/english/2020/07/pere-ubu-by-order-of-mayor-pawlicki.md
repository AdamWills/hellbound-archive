Pere Ubu are justifiably famed for their live albums (eight prior to this I believe). This album features early songs from the period 1975-1982 and comes across with a pleasing mixture of intensity and delicacy. 

 Dave Thomas, it has to be said, is a true original. No clichéd stage banter here. There is a bonus disc of encores which I love as it features classics like _Kick Out The Jams_ done as only _Pere Ubu_ can!

This is the way to do a live album-play from the heart!
