Another months goes by and we give you another month’s worth of staff picks and playlists from some of the folks at Hellbound. Feel free to add your own picks of the month in the comments!

## Steve Earles

**Listening to:**  Cherry Red's beautifully curated box set of six Goblin  
albums. Alongside acknowledged classics like the soundtracks to Zombi  
(AKA Dawn Of The Dead, and a great infliuence on the supurb band  
Zombi) and Susperia (one of the greatest soundtracks of all-time, even  
an influence on John Carpenter's seminal Halloween soundtrack) are  
original studio albums like the excellent Roller. I can't recommend  
this collection enough, it takes you on a inner voyage spiritually and  
mentally, it helps you cope with being alone, which we need now more  
than ever.
