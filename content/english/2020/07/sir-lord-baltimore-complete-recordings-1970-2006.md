Hailing from New York, the splendidly-named _Sir Lord Baltimore_ are one of those legendary proto-metal bands; a band that are much more listened to and significant decades after the fact. Do they live up to their own legend, I would say so. Their 1970 debut album _Kingdom Come_, is extremely heavy, and will appeal to people who like _Blue Cheer_, _MC5_, or _Black Sabbath_. Although, It’s way more out there than any of those bands. Tracks like _Master Heartache_ and _Hell Hound_ are excellent, as are the albums more trippy moments. The sound is superb, I don’t think a modern band could replicate it.

The following year they released their self-titled follow-up, which is more proggy, especially on _Man From Manhattan;_ which is really ambitious. Then that was it, the band spilt up, until a new version of the band appeared in 2006 with an album entitled _Raw._ While it is competent enough, it doesn’t actually do what it says on the tin, it isn’t raw in the sense of the first two albums - how could it be? But, it is a nice extra to the two outstanding first albums.

A valuable historical collection, but one that crackles with life, originality and energy.
