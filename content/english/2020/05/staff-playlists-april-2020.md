## Steve Earles

**New Release:** Hawkwind - _Roadhawks._ Hawkwind are the institution that gave the world Lemmy and without him I would not be typing this! Hawkwind are very special and _Silver Machine_ should be the Nation Anthem!

Otherwise with the virus I have been delving back into the past like Bruce Willis in _12 Monkeys._ Thus, I am currently listening to _Lock Up_ _The Wolves_ from Dio, and it's surprisingly great! Lovely.

## Arta Gailuma

**Listening to:** Rotting Christ. If not for Covid, I would see them live this coming weekend at Karmoygeddon, but then again there’s never too much of Rotting Christ..

**New release:** Cirith Ungol - _Forever Black._ Out on April 24th, 2020, via Metal Blade Records

**Symptomatic Slammers:** None. The music changes constantly depending on my mood and what YouTube’s algorithm thinks I’d like

## Gruesome Greg

**Listening to:** Saint Vitus - _Born Too Late_

**New release:** Tyrant - _Hereafter_

**Non-Metal:** The sound of pots and pans banging outside my window at 7:30 every day

**Wild card:** Last weekend, there was no lineup at the grocery store and the toilet paper aisle was fully stocked. Is this progress?

**Symptomatic Slammers:** Skinless - Trample the Weak, Hurdle the Dead

## Danielle Griscti

**Listening to:** ORANSSI PAZUZU - _Mestarin Kynsi_

Finnish spellcasters return to expand the realm of the possible.

Full review to come, for now enjoy the music video for "Uusi Teknokratia" :

**New release:** VOLUR - _Veiled City ft. Michael Eckert_

[https://volur.bandcamp.com/album/veiled-city-ft-michael-eckert](https://volur.bandcamp.com/album/veiled-city-ft-michael-eckert)

Toronto doom-and-gloom sweethearts subtly crescendo their way into frequent rotation.

**Live:** ENSLAVED at Verftet online music festival

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qwpBCH38U8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qwpBCH38U8)

Progression, reminiscence, and general all-out rulage in an audiophile's dream of a studio setup.

**Non-Metal:** DEEP SHIFT SOUND - _Four Meditations_

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpjPs0FBXoI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpjPs0FBXoI)

Far on the opposite end of the spectrum, ambient pieces of calm to soothe the surrounding chaos.

**Wild card:** LUSTRE - _The Ashes of Light_

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwM2aOI82Y0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwM2aOI82Y0)

Subtle screams co-exist with mellow, happy synths in a strange balance.

**Symptomatic Slammers:** BLOODY FORTRESS  - _Isolation_

Dank and delicious.

## Sean Palmerston

**Listening to:** Primordial - on a total Primordial kick and am listening to the 8 albums I own by them.

**New release:** My Dying Bride - _The Ghost of Orion_ (Metal Blade)

**Live:** Enslaved - Live in Concert (April 9, 2020 - online performance)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qwpBCH38U8&t=3697s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qwpBCH38U8&t=3697s)

Just amazing. Enslaved crush just as much without an audience as they do playing in front of a full house.

**Non-Metal:** Grateful Dead - _Dick's Picks Volume 36_ 

**Wild card:** Zombi - _Cosmos_ (Relapse)

**Symptomatic Slammers:** Edge of Sanity - _Crimson_ (Black Mark Production).

40 minutes of brilliance. A single song that weaves in and out of many styles of metal. The perfect headphone album.

## Sarah Riley

**Listening to:** Acid Bath - _When the Kite String Pops_ (Road Runner Records, 1994)

**New release:** Theres a couple new releases from this past month that I want to mention.

1. Becomes Astral - _Purgatory_ (Nomadic Arts, April 30th, 2020). Super rad Progressive metal band from Southern Ontario. Well worth checking them out and giving them a listen. Well worth supporting the Ontario metal community.

2. Benighted - _Obscene Repressed_ (Season of Mist, April 10th, 2020). If you're into Death/Grind you need to listen to this album. Absolutely brutal. In my opinion, it topped the newest _Aborted_release.

**Non-Metal:** The Cure - _A Forest_ (Seventeen Seconds, Fiction Records, 1980)

**Wild card:** Is it considered a cop out if I say _Tiger King_?

**Symptomatic Slammers:** Obituary - _Infected_ (Cause of Death, Roadrunner Records, 1990).

## Daniel Smith

**Listening to:** Death - _Leprosy_

**New release:** Oranssi Pazuzu - _Mestarin Kynsi_

**Non-Metal:** Fiona Apple - _Fetch the Bolt Cutters_

**Wild card:** The White Ribbon (2009) Directed by Michael Haneke

**Symptomatic Slammers:** Ulthar - _Through Downward Dynasties_
