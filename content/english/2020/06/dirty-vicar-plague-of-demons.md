Bred out of the pandemic and isolation, _Dirty Vicar_ comes screaming from the depths of hell like a choir of tortured souls led by a demonic conductor. Each track on _Plague of Demons_ brims with chaotic ferocity led by the vocalists tortured wails. Driven by raw NWOBHM power, _Plague of Demons_  has got to be my standout track on the record. While more focused than the other tracks, it doesn’t lose ANY of the ferocity and is a great way to close the EP.

If you wanna know about the other songs, go listen to it for yourselves right here!
