By the end of the 1971, the Vietnam War had raged for eight years without either side gaining a decisive advantage, and the Paris peace talks were achieving little if anything.

The United States was withdrawing itâ€™s own ground forces in South Vietnam at this point, while trying to train, strengthen and equip the South Vietnamese Army.

If ever North Vietnam was going to invade South Vietnam, it would have to be before the South got too strong.

On March 30, 1972, North Vietnamese forces invaded South Vietnam, making considerable gains, it was now only a matter of time for the South.

Well-written and illustrated, this book brings a crucial event in the Vietnam War to vivid life.
