Texas metal favourites **POWER TRIP** threw out a surprise this week - _Live In Seattle 05.28.18_ was issued through Dark Operative, and is now streaming for free.

It's been an absurd couple of weeks and all of us have been feeling the sting of this new harsh reality.  What better way to channel all that pent-up energy than with some ridiculously contagious riffs? If you've ever seen them live, you know that once is enough to get completely hooked.  You can colour me addicted after they played the Opera House here in Toronto last year.  Vocalist Riley is incredibly charismatic as a frontman and simultaneously full of so much rage and vitriol, it's impossible to not get caught up in the whirlwind of a set.  43 minutes feels like it goes by in a blink, like all the best shows do.  I had already been diving into their live sets while in lockdown mode - there's something about their thrashy/hardcore, nonstop fast-paced bounciness that is super fun and easy to get into, but also feels substantial and fresh.

Here's a bit from the official press release below.  Do yourself a favour this weekend and give it a dedicated listen with your speakers turned all the way up.  If you want to support the band, you can buy the album from their official Bandcamp page [**HERE**](http://powertrip.bandcamp.com).

_"Live In Seattle 05.28.18_ was recorded at Neumos while **POWER TRIP** was on their extensive tour with Sheer Mag, Red Death, and Fury. It has since been mixed and mastered by the band’s front of house engineer, Zachary Rippy of Sound Signal Audio. Through their searing crossover delivery, **POWER TRIP** unloads some of the choice cuts from their discography including “Executioner’s Tax (Swing of the Axe),” “Conditioned To Death,” “Firing Squad,” “Manifest Decimation,” and more..."

UGH!
