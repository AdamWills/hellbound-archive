This is an absolute gem of a book. It covers a much neglected aspect of the Great War, and is researched and written by the very talented Barbara Walsh.

As an Irishman with a strong interest in the role of the Irish in the Great War, I obviously found it a fascinating book. But, itâ€™s a very human story, very well-written, and one that deserves the widest possible audience.

I could see this book forming the basis for a very fine documentary. An enthralling and important book.
