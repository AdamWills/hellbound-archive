Starting straight out of the gates with a ripper of a beer swilling, hash smoking punk rock banger, **Sofa King Addicted** are back, taking no prisoners and drinking your bars dry. Recorded at the acclaimed Bathhouse Studios and mastered by Roger Lima (Less than Jake), _The Hard Carnival_ delivers track after track of pissed off fury, quirky riffs and killer hooks with relentless fury.

 By track three, I’ve switched to a much larger glass of whiskey, the volume inexplicably keeps increasing and I can only picture my neighbours skanking about their living rooms. The pace only quickens as _“The Time Is Now”_ blasts out the stereo; propelled by frenzied bass lines, and a driving drumbeat that sets the scene for what is perhaps one of the tightest songs on the record. _“The Hockey Anthem”_ has me yearning for a Saturday night hockey game and a case of beer, scoring a hat trick of tight hooks, powerful riffs and attitude.  All in all, _The Hard Carnival_ is Sofa King Addicted's strongest release to date. Keep your eyes peeled for these boys to hit the road as soon as they’re able!
