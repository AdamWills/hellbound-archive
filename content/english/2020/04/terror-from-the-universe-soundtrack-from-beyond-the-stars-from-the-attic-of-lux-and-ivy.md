Once again, in a time where an invisible virus (temporarily!) disrupts our way of life, along come Lux and Ivy with this literally out-of-this-world compilation to save us!

I love all the tunes herein, with special mention to those created by Sun-Ra; weird and wonderful doesn’t do him justice.

They should do a special episode of Ancient Aliens with this as the soundtrack.

I suspect the joy one feels on listening to this will keep COVID - 19 at bay, after all, viruses have no musical taste!
