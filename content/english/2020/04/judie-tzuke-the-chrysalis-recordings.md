This collection gather’s together all the music that Judie Tzuke made for Chrysalis Records from 1982 to 1983, it’s an impressive amount of music to be recorded in such a short time.

The first CD in this collection is the excellent _Shoot The Moon_ album. The second CD is a live album entitled _Road Noise: The Official Bootleg_ and is the highlight of this box set. Really great performances from Judie and she is backed up by an excellent band.

The third and final CD features the album _Ritmo_, along with interesting bonus track.

For fans of Judie Tzuke, this is essential.
