Hawkwind are a great musical institution, hugely influential, and of course, Hawkwind gave the world Lemmy. Without Lemmy, we would not have Motorhead, and our beloved heavy metal would sound like Poison!

So, _Roadhawks_ was originally compiled by Hawkwind mainstay Dave Brock (a kind of psychedelic Catweasel!) from Hawkwind’s United Artists albums. It was, of course, selected for a single vinyl album, and so only features eight tracks, but they are eight marvellous tracks.

Of greatest joy for me to hear is the legendary _Silver Machine_ with Lemmy on vocals. I note, this album was compiled shortly after Lemmy had been sacked for doing "the wrong drugs". (Being sacked from Hawkwind for taking drugs is too ironic for words, it’s like being sacked as a sumo wrestler for being fat).

I note that in the original sleeve notes, Lemmy is not thanked, though Michael Moorcock is. 

Atomhenge’s reissue has a lovely mini-poster of the album art by the legendary Barney Bubbles (possibly not his real name).

Opening track _Hurry On Sundown_ is a happy song, all about looking forward to the future, something we all need now in our lock down "existence". (I note as I write this towards the end of April that fatigue is setting in with people, virtual friendships it appears are not real ones).

So, as an antidote, crank up _Roadhawks,_ and enter Hawkwind’s world, where everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.
