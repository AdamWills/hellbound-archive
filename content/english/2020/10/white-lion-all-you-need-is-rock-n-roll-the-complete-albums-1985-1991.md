Interest in all things ‘80s shows no signs of abating soon; so this well-put together collection is sure to find an audience.

White Lion didn’t make the same success league as Poison or Bon Jovi for instance, yet they had platinum albums (which gives you some idea of just how many physical record sales there were in the ‘80s!). Yet to anyone who likes the aforementioned bands there is much to enjoy here. White Lion had some great hair metal songs, and for sure, this is an uplifting collection to listen to, one that 80s metal fans will love.
