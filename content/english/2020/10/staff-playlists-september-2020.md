Another round of staff playlists from the folks at Hellbound. This is what we’ve been spinning as summer turns to autumn (for those of us in the northern hemisphere, anyway). Feel free to add your own picks of the month in the comments!

### Steve Earles

**Listening to:** Darkthrone - _Arctic Thunder._ it perfectly sums up Autumn, my favourite time of the year, shorter days, longer nights, trees bare...Perfect!

### Arta Gailuma

**Listening to:** Dir En Grey [https://youtu.be/8W0h2yht6IA](https://youtu.be/8W0h2yht6IA)

### Gruesome Greg

**New release:** Sons of OTIS - _Isolation_

**Live:** -(16)- headlining Cvlt Nation's Sonic Unrest online fest, October 3rd, 2020.

**Non-Metal:** Kim Mitchell - _Lager and Ale_

**Wild card:** My restaurant-reviewing alter ego recommends Farmhouse Tavern in The Junction for country food and (the good kind of) country music.

### Sean Palmerston

**Listening to:** Paradise Lost - Their last 5 albums I just cannot get enough of. The new one isn't as great as _Medusa_, but it's still pretty fucking great.

****New release:**** Napalm Death -  _Throws of Joy In the Jaws of Defeatism._ I don't know how they keep doing it, but these grind core veterans just keep making albums better than the last. Honestly, their best new studio album since the early 90s.

****Non-Metal:**** Pendragon - _Love Over Fear._ 35 years into their career and these UK prog rockers have made their best album ever. Simply stunning!

**Wild card:** Premier league football. I watch it every Saturday and Sunday morning. Go Arsenal!
