As I’ve said in previous reviews, there is a great interest in all things ‘80s, and it would be hard to get more ‘80s than Sigue Sigue Sputnik, a band who were ahead of the curve big time. Technology has now caught up with their vision, and they would really have loved the internet age So, we have the original album, featuring the super catchy single _Love Missile F1-11,_ and such entertaining and catchy tracks as _Atari Baby_ (the ‘80s as I said!), and more. There are two excellent bonus discs of rarities and remixes. This was a big thing in the ‘80s (think of Frankie Goes To Hollywood), and I really love this. This is also a live disc, which is entertaining, albeit for completely different reasons! Overall, a worthwhile collection, and you just have to love the adverts the band included on _Flaunt It_!
