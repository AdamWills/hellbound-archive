Another month goes by and we give you another month’s worth of staff picks and playlists from some of the folks at Hellbound. Feel free to add your own picks of the month in the comments!

## Steve Earles

**Listening to:** _Born Again,_ Deluxe Edition by Black Sabbath. Bill
Ward, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler are joined on this fine platter of
metal by no less than Deep Purple legend Ian Gillan. It's my favourite
Sabbath album and _Zero The Hero_ is one great metal song. On
this splendid edition there is an unreleased track called _The_
_Fallen,_ which is splendid, and a very good live show from the Reading
Festival. To accompany it I am reading a very good book by Martin
Popoff called _Born Again! Black Sabbath In The Eighties And_
_Nineties_, which I highly recommend. A great antidote to the isolated
times we find ourselves "living" in.
