Featuring the soaring talents of vocalist/bassist Glenn Hughes, these reissues of three superb _Trapeze_ albums are most welcome. _Trapeze_ is an excellent debut, though the band would show far more of their own identity on subsequent releases. _Medusa_ shows how well the power trio format worked for _Trapeze_, with guitarist Mel Galley and Glenn meshing particularly well. It’s simply a collection of terrific tunes. Finally, _You Are The Music…We’re Just The Band_ shows _Trapeze_ at full-strength.

Three timeless albums that any music lover should own
