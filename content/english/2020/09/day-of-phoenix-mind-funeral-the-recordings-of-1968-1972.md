 Now that’s an excellent name for a band, and this is an excellent compilation. It seems there were so many interesting progressive rock bands in the late 60 and early 70s, and _Day Of Phoenix_ are no exception.

 There is a pleasing element of the psychedelic to _Day Of Phoenix’s_ prog rock, not surprising when you consider the time they recorded their music in.

 Overall, an excellent compilation of songs that would be extremely expensive to purchase in their original form.
