Since his ground-breaking bass-playing for _Public Image Limited_, Jah Wobble has become one of the world’s most distinctive bassist, a true innovator and artist, his creativity is boundless. As is evidenced on this superb compilation.

Truly superb, this is music made for the love of music, which is the only reason music should be made.
