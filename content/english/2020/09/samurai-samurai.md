Samurai (born from the ashes of a band called WEB if memory serves me correct) disbanded shortly after the release of their self-titled debut; they would be held in the same high esteem as the likes of King Crimson, Colosseum and their ilk. If Samurai had stayed together, who knows what musical heights they might have scaled.

 This the definitive reissue of their sole album, the superb remastering from the original Greenwich Gramophone master tapes gives superb clarity to what is an excellent album, the track _Face In The Mirror_ being a stand-out for me.

It’s not an immediate album, I mean that as a compliment, it rewards the listener more with repeated listening.

Another gem from Esoteric!
