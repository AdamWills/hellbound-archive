The New Wave Of British Heavy Metal has acquired a legendary status amongst music lovers. Not only was it a highly influential movement (without the NWOBHM, we would not have had bands of the status of Metallica for instance) but it has an innocence and purity which would be hard to countenance in these more cynical self-obsessed post-internet days. It was all about the love of metal and community; something we all crave within. This is music at a primordial level.

It is also music created with love, and it’s very good quality music. This is brilliantly put together compilation and it all has great merit. So, just to pick a few personal highlights - Diamond Head’s ‘In The Heat of the Night’, Venom’s ‘Live Like An Angel…’, Mantas’s killer cover of ‘The Green Manalisha’ is superb, and some real gems from the likes of Jaguar, Rock Goddess (‘Satisfied Then Crucified’ is a great title too!) and Girlschool.

Hopefully, this superb collection will inspire a whole new wave of bands!
