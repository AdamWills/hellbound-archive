Back in the happy pre-pandemic days when one could go to a gig, seeing Glenn Hughes at the Olympia in Dublin was one of the best gigs I’ve ever seen. Glenn has a fantastic way with his audience and is a magnificent singer.

Quite simply, this superb six disc set captures Glenn’s magic perfectly, and is the perfect aural antidote to the dark lonely isolated times we now find ourselves ‘living’ in. The Voice of Rock reigns eternal as always!
