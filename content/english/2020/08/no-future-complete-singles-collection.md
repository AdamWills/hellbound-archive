No Future was a seminal punk record label, and this well compiled collection gathers together every single A and B side released by them, the majority of which made the Independent Music Charts.

As well as being an important and entertaining collection of music, you would never be able to afford to collect all this music in its original format. So, it’s great value for money. Overall, an excellent snapshot of the sound of UK punk rock in 1982.
