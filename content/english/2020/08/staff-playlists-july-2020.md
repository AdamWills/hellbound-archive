Welcome to Hellbound’s latest collection of staff picks and playlists. Enjoy these recommendations and tell us what you’re listening to in the comments!

## Steve Earles

**New release:** Fu Manchu - _Godzillas/Eating Dust._ Killer Cover of Thin Lizzy's - _J__ailbreak,_ and of course, a Blue Oyster Cult cover, and their own  
stuff is awesome. What's not to like?

**Live:** _Status Quo_. Intitially I didn't actually take to this one  
much, but it has grown on me, and I've come to really like it.  
  
**Wild Card:**  1. David Bowie - _The Next Day._ We will never see his like again.  
 2. Metal Church: The Elektra Years. We must all heed the words of  
Fenriz when he says that if someone asked him what metal is, he would  
play them _Beyond The Black._

## Arta Gailuma
