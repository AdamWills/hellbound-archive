## By Martin Bowman

### Published by Pen & Sword Aviation

Though ‘Operation Sealion’, Hitler’s proposed invasion of South England, never took place, Hitler openly confided that ‘even a small invasion’ might go a long way.

Indeed, such a move could have sown panic in England on a massive scale and involved the British having to use vital military resources they were in no position to spare.

If even a small invasion of Britain took place, it would have been in the interest of the British authorities to cover it up to avoid panic and demoralisation.

Martin is an excellent author and historian; his book is well-researched and will give the reader much food for thought. Which is what a good book should do.
