## ‘Inside the Discordant New World of Film Scoring’

### By Stephan Eicke

#### Published by McFarland

Music is a big part of cinema and television and this interesting book features revealing interviews with more than forty composers, giving the reader an insight into what goes into a composing a score.

What surprised me is often how little a budget the studios allow for their films; composers have often created very good scores on a very limited budget indeed.

This is a very interesting book; the chapter on Hans Zimmer alone makes it worthwhile and I have to say I learned a lot from reading it.

Recommended.
