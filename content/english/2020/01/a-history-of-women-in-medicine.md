## ‘Cunning Women, Physicians, Witches’

### By Sinead Spearing

#### Published by Pen & Sword

When I was little I would hear stories of elderly ladies who had the ability to cure various aches and pains and illnesses. That knew herbal cures, that knew how to find the rights plants to cure the right ailment.

As an adult I realise this was true; a folk memory if you will, and part of a long tradition of female physicians. This fine and timely book explores the history of these wise women who were of great service to their communities. These same good women would be scourged and slandered by the Patriarchy as witches.

Beautifully researched and written; this book contains real insights. Sadly too, it is all too relevant today, where in much of the world women are still repressed and ill-treated.

Thus, this is a book that truly deserves the widest possible audience. For without studying history, we are doomed to repeat it.
