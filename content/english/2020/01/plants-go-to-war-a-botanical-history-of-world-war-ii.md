Sometimes you have the pleasure of reviewing a book that’s so brilliant and original, you wonder why no one has ever thought of writing it before.

‘Plants Go To War’ explores the military history of World War Two from the perspective of the huge role pants played in the conflict.

For instance, with the need for whatever meat was available to go for the war effort, ways had to be found to substitute vegetables for meat in food for cats and dogs.

Plants were used to build planes, to make clothes, to feed troops, to make medicine, the list is endless.

This book is book is beautifully written and researched. I would like to see it reach the widest possible audience and it would make the basis for an excellent documentary.
