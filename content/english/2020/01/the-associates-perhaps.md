The 80s were a golden era for pop music in the UK, and The Associates were very much part of this. Hailing from Dundee, the band achieved some success with their 1982 album ‘Sulk’. The follow-up ‘Perhaps’, did not appear until 1985, an eternity in 1980s terms.

_Perhaps_ is an excellent 80s pop album and I feel that had it been released sooner, the band would have gone on to greater success.

This worthy version of ‘Perhaps’ features an entire CD of rarities and really does the band justice.
