Another year ends and a new one begins. Thanks for hanging with us in 2019. Stick around for lots more to come in 2020! This month, in addition to our usual staff playlists, some of us Hellbound folks have nominated our 2019 and all-decade favourites and highlighted what we're looking forward to in this new year.

## Hellbound recommends: thinking back and looking ahead

### Bill Adams

**Listening to:** Steven Bradley - _Summer Bliss and Autumn Tears (Porterhouse)_: From note one, it’s perfectly apparent how much a labor of love Summer Bliss and Autumn Tears was for Steven Bradley. On each cut on Summer Bliss and Autumn Tears, there’s no question at how much time the singer took writing and re-writing the music and lyrics, tightening the elements until they’re diamond perfect and precious. Guest appearances by artists like Jonny Wickersham (Social Distortion), Wayne Kramer (MC5) and Steven McDonald (OFF!, Redd Kross and Melvins) are really just the icing on the cake here - the album radiates a quality of craft that is impossible to deny. Nothing about it is what you’d expect reader, and that’s what makes it great.

**New release:** Drew Thomson Foundation - s/t - Not exactly BRAND NEW, but released within the last couple of months - and I haven’t finished my review of it yet because I remain so captivated by it that I forget to pick up a pen while listening.

**Non-Metal:** Because all my picks are non-metal, how about I include a metal album here instead? I choose Bowels of Earth by Entombed A.D. The last time I paid any attention to the members of Entombed was around 1993, when the band released Wolverine Blues. The truth is that I became interested when I saw an ad for it in an X-Men comic book, and Wolverine Blues became my first real introduction to death metal. Ironically, I’ve been pretty picky about anything I’ve heard which has come out of the genre since, but particularly of what I have heard come from Entombed; to say that I have found the band’s output spotty is an understatement and I’ve had a lot of difficulty finding much to like in the band’s catalogue at all. Now over a quarter century after the release of Wolverine Blues, Entombed has broken up and restructured itself under the name Entombed A.D. and, with Bowels of Earth (the group’s third album under its new moniker), the band has found its way back into something I like which incorporates measures of hard rock, metal and hardcore punk similar to those the group tested out back in the day.

**Wild card:** Jim Carroll Band - _Catholic Boy (Fat Possum reissue)_: I’m not sure how it worked out, but this year has really been all about great reissues for Fat Possum Records. In addition to several titles from EL-P and X, Fat Possum reissued Catholic Boy by Jim Carroll Band, and accidentally reissued a perfect connection between New York punk and new wave in so doing. Of course, fans of Leonardo DiCaprio and The Basketball Diaries will recognize “People Who Died” and “Catholic Boy” (although the version which appears here is not the one which features Pearl Jam behind Carroll) as well as the junkier side of Carroll, much of the B-side of the album is more new wave-flavoured than punk, but doesn’t fall all the way into synths and skinny ties. Rather, it could be argued that the new wave quotient is a little more embryonic, which makes it absolutely compelling to listen to.
