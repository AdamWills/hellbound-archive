## By John Mayall with Joel McIver

### Published by Omnibus Press

With a career that spans an impressive sixty years, John Mayall is living musical history. There are few artists you can say that about.

Moreover, John’s famous Bluesbreakers have introduced some of the most famous and influential musicians in the world. The roster includes John McVie (Fleetwood Mac), Mick Fleetwood (Fleetwood Mac), Eric Clapton (Cream), Mick Taylor (The Rolling Stones), and Peter Green (Fleetwood Mac).

John’s story is amazing; they say to play the blues you have to live the blues and as you turn the pages of this most engaging book, you will see John most certainly has _lived_ his life.

Credit must be given to both John and his very able co-writer Joel McIver for bringing John’s story to life in such a vivid way: you truly do feel you are there as you read it.

Quite simply, this book is essential reading for anyone who loves the blues, who loves rock, music, even just loves life.

Essential!
