## By Terry Deary

### Published by Pen and Sword History

I love the **_Horrible Histories_** books; back in the day I bought them all for Becky, my youngest sister. Terry has a talent for making history both interesting and informative, often by concentrating on the horrible aspects as you’d imagine.

I wish we’d been taught history like that at school!

This fine book is more for older readers than his usual books and I feel it will have a wide audience.

Terry’s great talent is his ability to make history come to life. How many writers would have the genius to quote legendary comedian Ken Dodd: “_I have kleptomania. But when_ _it gets bad, I take something for_ _it_.” Alongside this he quotes Napoleon: “_The Infectiousness_ _of crime is like that of the plague_.” Terry is a one-off writer!

The true story of Dick Turpin is a good example of the quality of this book; rather than the folk hero of legend, Turpin was actually an unpleasant and none-too-smart criminal.

Highly accessible and this book would make a fine present.
