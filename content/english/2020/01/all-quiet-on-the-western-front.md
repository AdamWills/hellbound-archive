## A Graphic Novel Adaptation by Wayne Vansant

### Published by Dead Reckoning

This fine graphic novel is based on the classic and sadly timeless book by Erich Maria Remarque, sadly as relevant now as when it was published, for men forever ignore the warning of history and repeat the same mistakes again and again.

Remarque was very clear in his intentions in writing ‘All Quiet On The Western Front’; he did not intend it to be some ‘boys-own’ style fiction, to inspire a new generation with the hideous idea that war is ‘noble’. He wrote: “This book is neither to be an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure. For death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escape its shells were destroyed by the war.”

To my mind this important graphic novel serves as a good companion piece to Pat Mills and Joe Colquhon’s classic series of graphic novels, ‘Charley’s War’, one of the most important World War One stories created in any medium.

…to discover more about ‘Charley’s War’ for yourselves.

‘All Quiet On The Western’ front has been beautifully adapted. The story and characters are 100% believable. All human life is here, and sadly death too.

Tragic and moving in equal measure, ‘All Quiet On The Western Front’ is highly recommended
