## By Will Johnson

### Published by Inner Traditions

In a world which is becoming increasingly more fraught and fragmented by the minute (just look at the news), the importance of breathing and meditation cannot be underestimated.

For, and this is a harsh truth but a truth nonetheless, the average person can do little to influence, not only the larger events in the world, but even the smaller ones that surround us.

Whether a person is religious or not (and that is entirely their own business), modern psychology backs up the Buddhist teaching that unhappiness comes from wanting things (material objects, power, love, rare Star Wars toys, you name it, it causes it). In other words, rather than being hapless victims of reality, a harsh truth is that our reaction to that reality is entirely our own. It matters as much as we allow it to matter, and that control comes from breathing properly, from meditation and contemplation.

Will’s book is a wonderful way to achieve this; part memoir, part ‘how to’ book, I honestly can’t recommend it enough.

One of the best investments you could ever make is purchasing this book!
