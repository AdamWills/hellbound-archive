## The Studio Albums 1995-2003

Glenn Hughes is a living legend, a member of Trapeze, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and more beside. Moreover, he is a legend who still possesses his legendary voice of rock! Seeing him at the Olympia in Dublin playing his classic Deep Purple set will stay cemented in my memory as a superb and joyous gig!

This great value for money set features no less than six albums: ‘Feel’ (1995’, ‘Addiction’ (1996’, ‘The Way It is (199), ‘Return Of Crystal Karma; (2000), ‘Building The Machine’ (2001) and the aptly titled ‘Songs In the Key of Rock’ (2003).

All are superb, with ‘Return Of Crystal Karma’ being my favourite.

Simply essential.
