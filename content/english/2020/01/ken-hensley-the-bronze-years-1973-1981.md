Ken Hensley has had a long, varied and distinguished musical career, and really deserves this fine 3 CD/ DVD box set of his years with, as you might guess from the title, Bronze Records (home to the likes of Motorhead during the days of the Three Amigos line-up, for instance).

Ken is most famous for his work with Uriah Heap; prior to that he had played with the likes of future Rolling Stone Mick Taylor. With Uriah Heap he played on no less than 13 studio albums: so much classic rock!

The first of Hensley's Bronze solo albums, ‘Proud Words On A Dusty Shelf’, is an excellent album, and will really appeal to Uriah Heap fans, featuring as it does, much of the band.

The second solo album ‘Eager to Please’ is a fine piece of work (interestingly, featuring Shakin’ Stevens’ guitarist B.J. Cole.

His third solo album ‘Free Spirit’ marked Ken’s departure from Uriah Heap (the clue is in the title), and is again, an excellent album. Some excellent guests musicians too, such as Trevor Bolder from The Spiders From Mars and Deep Purple’s Ian Paice.

Finally, as the icing on an already tasty cake, there is a DVD of interviews Ken gave to renowned journalist Malcolm Dome (a walking encyclopaedia of rock and metal). A real treat.

This collection really puts Ken’s musical importance in perspective.
