Everyone does (or should) know who [Luke Haines](https://www.facebook.com/lukehainesuk/) and [Peter Buck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buck) are, so I won’t waste words on that.

What is important is their splendid new album. What really makes it special is their chemistry and terrific song-writing: it really is organic alchemy.

And speaking of alchemy, how can you not love an album whose subject matter includes Jack Parsons (rocket scientist extraordinaire, and an occultist and follower of Aleister Crowley) and The Enfield Hauntings.

This is the way all music should be made, but sadly isn’t.

Extraordinary and essential in equal measure.
