## 03.03.2020 Rebellion Manchester, UK

First on stage was Australian prog metal project I **Built The Sky**. I find it is harder for instrumental bands to keep things going on live shows. I mean, having to rely on instruments to tell the story is already a skill on its own, but on top of that to be able to keep fans interested is a whole new level, but these Aussies had no issue with that at all.  The frontman Rohan Stevenson was chatting continuously to the fans in between the songs and the initiation of “Hi five wall of death” did see many participants and since there weren’t enough people in the room for a crowd surf, he still went for a “piggyback ride” on one fan’s shoulders while continuing to play some intricate tunes.

Already a house hold name in UK’s metal core scene, **Heart Of A Coward** did create a good stir in the crowd from the first tunes they played and the moshpit did not stop for their whole set.

The short under 40 minute time slot did contain pieces from band’s whole discography, however was focused on the two latest releases- _Deliverance_ (2015) and the latest studio album _The Disconnect_ which came out in 2019.

And then it was time for the headliners. Although gone recently through some line up changes, seems like British prog metallers **Monuments** are on top of the game. Having witnessed frontman ‘s Andy Cizek’s (Makari) first steps with the group at the Euroblast Festival last year filling in for Chris Baretto, it was great to see him killing it now as an official member of Monuments. His vocals were spot on and the whole performance was as brilliant as always.

The before last date of bands European tour before crossing the big pond in April for their North American tour was fantastic! Fans were enjoying themselves jumping, screaming and moshing and pure, raw energy was trough the roof!

What a night! Even though I mainly stick to concerts local to me, and the over two hour trip was well worth it!
