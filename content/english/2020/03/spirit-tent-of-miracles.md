Once again _Cherry Red_ do justice to the legacy of _Spirit_.

This is a more recent _Spirit_ album than many of _Cherry Red’s_ other re-released but of equal quality.

The line-up on this album features Randy California on guitar and vocal, Ed Cassidy on drums and Mike Nile on bass and vocals, a tight knit power trio they are too.

_Tent of Miracles_ is a fine album in it’s own right, enhanced by some interesting bonus material, but it’s the live disc that really makes this a special release.

_Spirit_ fans will find much to enjoy here.
