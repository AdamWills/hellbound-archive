Welcome to Hellbound's latest edition of our staff playlists and picks! This month there's an added category we're calling _symptomatic slammers._ It's a choice of any tunes that help to pass the time while people begin to get some cabin fever practicing social distancing. We hope you enjoy these recommendations and let us know what you’re listening to in the comments!

## Steve Earles

**Live:** No live pick this month for obvious reasons. However, I found a  
new stray cat that some git abandoned when the virus started (could  
you all please welcome Salem to the fold). Now I have five cats, I'm  
gonna teach 'em to play Heavy Metal - that'd be purr-fect. :)

**Non-metal:** _Terror From The Universe._ Groovy 60s sci-fi based tunes  
courtesy of _The Cramps_!

**Wild card:** Ozzy Osbourne - _Blizzard of Oz_, looking forward to seeing  
the Ozman when this is all over, and they don't come any wilder than  
Ozzy.

**Symptomatic slammers:** Mike Oldfield's - _Tubular Bells,_ always uplifting.

## Arta Gailuma

**Listening to:** _Dynazty_. Was really looking forward to see these guys live at Karmoygeddon festival end of April. Will have to be some other time, hopefully soon.

**Wild card:** Still planning to go to London for Desertfest on May 1 -- although I expect that to be cancelled any day now...
