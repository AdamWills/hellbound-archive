Usually when musicians attempt writing novels the results are more dire than Daniel O’Donnell doing a duet with Cliff Richard!

In the words of Charles Grey in the _The Devil Rides Out_, such is not the case here.

Indeed J.B. Morrison, otherwise the artist known as Jim Bob, the singer with indie pop superstars Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine.

J.B has the artists eye to observe the world, moreover he the skill to distil what he sees there.

Furthermore, he has the courage to put his thought to paper, something I feel the Coronavirus Pandemic will induce us all to do. We will all have to start telling the truth to ourselves and others to get through this. If we do, I feel the world will be a better place.

_A Godawful Small Affair_ tells the tale of ten-year-old Nathan’s search for his abducted sister Zoe. J.B. has really captured Nathan’s perspective of the world perfectly.

It’s a beautifully written tale of love and loss.

The second novel _Harvey King Unboxes His Family_ explores some deep questions about what we believe to be real and the actual truth because these aren’t the same things.

Now, we all have more time to read, these novels are well worth your time.
