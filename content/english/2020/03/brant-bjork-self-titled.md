Man, **Brant Bjork** has been really prolific lately – between reissues and new issues, this is the fourth record of his I’ve reviewed since 2018. And with its stripped-down, laidback, lo-fi vibes, and Brant playing every single instrument, this might be the closest he’s come to [_Jalamanta_](https://hellbound.ca/2019/08/brant-bjork-jalamanta-reissue/) in a while.

That said, you won’t find some of the extended psychedelic jams of his debut on this one, as _Brant Bjork_ clocks in just shy of 38 minutes. Leadoff single “Jungle in the Sound” starts things off with a cool, desert-rock riff that recalls “Automatic Fantastic.” But this one is more laidback and compact, at a shade over four minutes, with a mellower vocal and what sounds like congas in the background. “Mary (You’re Such a Lady)” settles into a similar mellow groove, albeit with a little more urgency in the chorus, as Brant appears to be pining after a biblical figure, a theme that seems to continue on “Jesus Was a Bluesman.”

At six-and-a-half minutes, “Cleaning Out the Ashtray” is a little longer, with a more extended instrumental jam section, although it still follows a fairly structured verse/chorus pattern for the first couple minutes, ending with an extended chorus that will surely get stuck in your head. “Shitkickin’ Now” is a little more uptempo, at 3:16, driven by a bluesy guitar riff and a faster drumbeat, but still coming across as very minimalist.

“Stardust & Diamond Eyes” is another tune that wouldn’t sound outta place on _Jalamanta_, with a consistently groovy riff before taking an unexpected turn into some super-slow-mo, doom-metal tempos on a very memorable chorus. He’s not singing about smoking bongs and worshipping Satan, though – this is actually a love song. Whodathunkit?
