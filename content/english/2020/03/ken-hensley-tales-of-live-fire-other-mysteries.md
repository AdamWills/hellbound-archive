It’s fair to say Cherry Red are doing a grand job on curating and preserving Ken Hensley’s legacy, and _Tales Of Live Fire & Other Mysteries_ is a worthy addition to that cannon.

While Ken’s work with Uriah Heap is sublime I feel this collection really shows his versatility as an artist.

Overall, a well wrought value-for-money collection.
