A very good value for money package from Cherrt Red of two classic Jefferson Airplane albums.

‘Long John Silver’ is as inspired by religion as it is by revolution. Tracks like ‘The Son of Jesus’ are inspired by Gnostic writing. The musical performances are excellent, especially Grace Slick as you’d expect. The live ‘Thirty Seconds Over Winterland’ is very good too, Jefferson Airplane’s music really comes alive on stage.

A must for fans of Jefferson Airplane.
