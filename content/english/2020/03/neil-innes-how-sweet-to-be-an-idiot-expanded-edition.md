Neil Innes’ Sad and unexpected death in December 2019 left the world bereft of a truly original musical and comic talent.

Neil was well known in the 60s and 70s for his work with the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah band, Monty Python, and the much-loved spoof of The Beatles called The Rutles (‘All You Need is Cash!’)

While, obviously, humour is very prominent in Neil’s music, the music itself is very good.

Catchy and uplifting, an ideal antidote to the atmosphere we currently find ourselves in.
