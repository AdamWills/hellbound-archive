The Monochrome Set are one of the great bands you’ve never heard of, but in a just world (which this certainly isn’t!) you would have. A big influence on the likes of The Smiths, The Monochrome Set is well represented in this fine collection (of which only the splendidly named _Dante’s Casino_ album has been reissued on CD before).

Their songs are infectious, and while you may not know The Monochrome Set, you’ll hear their musical DNA in so many more well-known acts.

Highly recommended.
