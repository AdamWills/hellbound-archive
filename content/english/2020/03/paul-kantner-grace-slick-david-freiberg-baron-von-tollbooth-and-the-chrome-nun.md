This splendidly-named album is one of the finest pieces of music to emerge from the extensive Jefferson Airplane family. Without doubt if it had been released under the Jefferson Airplane monicker, it would be very well known. Kudos to Cherry Red for this fine re-mastered edition.

I feel this release is more progressive and out there than Jefferson Airplane, freed from the restraints of fans’ expectations, but the material is very strong, and the performances are great, especially Grace Slick.

Incidentally, the album title comes from the nicknames David Crosby gave to Grace Slick and Paul Kantner.

With the original artwork restored, this is a must for any fans of Jefferson Airplane.
