The Primitives are a great indie band that managed to cross over to mainstream audiences without losing what made them special in the first place. Really when you look at the soulless dreck out there (‘music’ that revolves around materialism, violence etc.), The Primitives have tons of personality.

This five disc set showcases a truly astonishing plethora of music, albums, live, b-sides, unreleased music, BBC sessions, in a beautifully put together package.

All pop bands should be more like The Primitives!
