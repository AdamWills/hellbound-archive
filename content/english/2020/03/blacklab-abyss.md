Japanese duo Blacklab’s new album is a gigantic leap forward from previously released music. The sheer plate-shattering density of their riffs is still there, but song-wise, production-wise, playing wise, everything has taken a gigantic leap forward. Their huge riffs now have a huge groove to them.

While it’s undeniably heavy, it’s also pleasingly melodic. Blacklab are a band that definitely has a wide ranging appeal.

Finally, I would say Blacklab have tapped into the zeitgeist- they are the perfect soundtrack for a virus-plagued world.
