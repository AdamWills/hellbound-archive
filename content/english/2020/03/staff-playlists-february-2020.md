## Hellbound recommends

### Bill Adams

**Listening to:** Green Day – _Father of All Motherfuckers_

**New release:** Green Day – _Father of All Motherfuckers_.

While the actual release of Green Day's thirteenth full-length studio album is a little difficult to define (singles began coming out shortly after recording wrapped in September 2019, putting a rush on release as tracks continued to appear), there's no question that it is a red letter album. Clocking in at less than a half-hour in length, the album bravely ignores basically EVERY keystone sound the band has used as calling cards over the years (no buzzsaw guitars, no bouncing bass lines, no Rob Cavallo production) and rethinks the whole damned thing while STILL managing to sound like Green Day (exception being the album's title track – which sounds like an Eagles of Death Metal song). Here, the band basically reaches in every direction it can for fresh inspiration, and is never left grasping at straws. Each cut (but particularly “I Was a Teenage Teenager,” “Stab You in the Heart” and “Fire, Ready, Aim”) comes out strongly with a fresh, vintage R&B influence (think Little Richard, in the early days of his career), and leaves listeners wide-eyed with the band's audacity, but also eager to hear more. Looking at the band's entire catalogue, there's little doubt that Dookie and American Idiot are the biggest albums Green Day has ever done, but Father of All Motherfuckers will end up having made a strong and believable play for the title of their “most exciting album.”

**Non-Metal:** Territories – _Short Seller_ (CD Record)

On paper, my mind wobbled at the idea of this release. “This is a playable vinyl record made using a CD press,” proclaimed the press release which accompanied my review copy of Territories' “Short Seller” CD Record. “CDs  are dead. Long live vinyl.”Anyone who is familiar with how formats emerge knows that the first couple of years after any new format emerges are marked by perfecting the releases themselves, and the advent of CD Records is no different. In this case, the sound quality was generally godawful, but finding the song on youtube revealed that Territories are definitely onto something comparable to Melodic Hardcore bliss. The guitars are tightly wound and infectious, and Kyle Hegel's vocals rival that of the work he did with Knucklehead. The whole problem is this new format – it needs refinement. In the meantime, check “Short Seller” out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdocd-za7K4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdocd-za7K4)

**Wild card:** Charger - _Watch Your Back_ (12''single)

What might you get if you invited Social Distortion to attend a seance to contact Lemmy Kilmister in the afterlife and the Motorhead frontman actually showed up to jam? The results would sound a lot like this. Thanks to Matt Freeman (Rancid's bassist, but the bassist and singer, here) and drummer Jason Willer (of Guantanamo School of Medicine), along with guitarist Andrew McGee for turning it loose on the world. Start with this single, get won by it and then seek out the full-length.
