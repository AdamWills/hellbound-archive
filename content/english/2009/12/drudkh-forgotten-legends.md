**By Laura Wiebe Taylor**

Opening with a loon’s cry, _Forgotten Legends_ announces its natural preoccupations right up front before launching into three momentous tracks of Ukrainian pagan black metal. The first of several Drudkh reissues from Season of Mist, _Forgotten Legends_ captures the band’s early rumblings – a small collection of long songs recorded in the summer of 2002 and released as the band’s official debut. The eerie album artwork, expanded for the re-release, underlines Drudkh’s interweaving of nature and harsh music, a blurry forest and lake bathed in infernal light directly invoking titles like “Forests in Fire and Gold” and “False Dawn.” Despite the epic song lengths, _Forgotten Legends_ isn’t an ambling or loose affair. Drudkh drive their riffs to near-exhaustion while maintaining a continuous constraint. Underneath the droning persistence lies a delicate sense of melody, cloaked in raw distortion that undermines the stifling precision holding it all together. It’s an uncomfortable but delicious balance that culminates in a two and a half minute thunderstorm (“Smell of Rain”). If you already know Drudkh well, none of this is new, but _Forgotten Legends_ is essential folkish black metal listening if you missed it the first time around.
