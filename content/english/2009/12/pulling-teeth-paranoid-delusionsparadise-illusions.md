**By Keith Carman** Pulling Teeth's latest five-song affair _Paranoid Delusions/Paradise Illusions_ is an eerie look into what the mind of a psychotic killer might be: frenzied, disjointed and abusive yet incredibly compelling. Ravaging the likes of death metal through their pummelling low-end yet still sinewy enough to throw out an expedient rage worthy of Converge before laying back into a doomy groove, the album is another barrage of vicious torment coupled with cacophonous blast beats, undulating breakdowns and a general sense of something out of The Exorcist. However, despite a terminal sense of Attention Deficit Disorder, the band's furious relation of each ensuing part is never dull or off-putting. In the end, _Paranoid Delusions/Paradise Illusions_ comes across as sort of extreme music opera where songs are movements and parts rather than isolated performances. Accomplished and progressive while still heartfelt and rabid, this is easily the band's best offering to date.
