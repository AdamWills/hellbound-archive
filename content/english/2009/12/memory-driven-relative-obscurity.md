**By Keith Carman**

Barely squeaking into the realms of bona fide metal, Oklahoma City's Memory Driven seem more intent on crossing over between the worlds of radio-friendly hard music and the more lenient metallions than dedicating themselves to something of true merit. A majority of half-time opuses with overwrought vocal delivery prevail on _Relative Obscurity_, rendering this a strange mash-up of Tool's epic tendencies, Alice In Chains' drawling rock and Opeth's efforts a creating a foggy mysticism around everything. Unfortunately though, they're not quite capable of pulling off any of these intentions to the extent of their influences. The end result is a rather depressing affair due to both the atmosphere and less-than-stellar results. For lack of a better way to put it (and with all due respect), this is exactly like that saccharine, non-committal stuff Dog The Bounty Hunter features on his show.
