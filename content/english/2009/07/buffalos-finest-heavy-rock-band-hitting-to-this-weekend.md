I know a guy who books a couple bars in Buffalo, and considers himself the king of their scene.  (Well, he told me that in an email once, but I dunno if he was serious.)  When I couldn't get his band to play the Sunday Stoner Rock Spectacular last year, since it fell on a Jewish holiday, he suggested I get in touch with Chylde.  Unfortunately, I searched Myspace for Child and couldn't find em, since this suggestion was made over the telephone.  When I later found out how their name was spelt, I was bummed for not looking into them sooner.

Alas, [Chylde](http://www.myspace.com/chyldemusic) will be making their Toronto debut at The Horseshoe Tavern this Saturday, along with local heavy psych phenoms [Quest For Fire](http://www.myspace.com/questforfireband), who are returning to the site of their greatest triumph -- the opening gig for Witch and Earthless that inked them a deal with Tee Pee Records.  The two opening bands are of the softer variety, although The Saffron Sect were pretty impressive when they played Blood Ceremony's CD release party back in January.  If you're into the heavy psychedelic grooves of Sleep, Nebula, Fu Manchu and their ilk, The Horseshoe is the place to be on Saturday!
