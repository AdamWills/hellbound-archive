Here are some photos taken during Sunday night's show. Hellbound Radio is the weekly show that Kevin Stewart-Panko and I have been doing for the past three years. Our good pal and Hellbound contributor Albert Mansour has been sitting in for the past few shows. He took most of these photos (except the ones of him, which I took).

Kevin & Sean:

Kevin does his best Lemmy:

Kevin and Sean with some classic metal albums and CDs, including Tokyo Blade, Attomica and Possessed:

Albert poses with the second Attomica album, which he and his brother wrote all the lyrics for:

Sean with some more metal classics from Savatage, Morgoth, Exhorder and Anvil:

[![C101.5FM 007a](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/C101.5FM-007a1-300x225.jpg "C101.5FM 007a")](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/C101.5FM-007a1.jpg)

I wrote a detailed history on the show but my autosave failed and the computer crashed, so I'll have to do it again later. For the meantime I hope you enjoyed these silly photos I've posted for your viewing enjoyment.
