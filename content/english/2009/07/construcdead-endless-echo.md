_By Albert Mansour_

The fourth full-length album by this death/thrash metal band from Stockholm, Sweden, this twelve-song album was recorded at Not Quite Studio with producers Klas Ideberg and Peter Wildoer of the band Darkane. Fans of Nevermore, Satanic Slaughter, Witchery and the aforementioned Darkane will love this album. The vocals sound like those of Peter Dolving, lead singer for the Haunted. _Endless echo_ contains a brand of energetic, melodic thrash that is just a complete aggressive metal listen; tracks like “No exit,” "My Haven” and “Spiritual shift” are both very fast and very intense. Rage is the best word to describe the reaction I had after listening to this CD. It got me all fired up. The only thing I dislike about this album is that it sounds at times a little bit too much like At the Gates, The Haunted, etc. There's not a large amount of originality, Although I do say that this album is quite good and I would pull it out from time to time. the question remains though is it really worth a purchase? I can honestly say that I don't know as the album wouldn't really stand out in my collection and there's a good chance that it won't in yours, but if you are big into thrash and Swedish metal then I would say it would be a good idea to at least give the album a try before you write it off.
