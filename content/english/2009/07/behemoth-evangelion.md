_By Jonathan Smith_

Poland’s Behemoth have returned with their ninth album in nineteen years, and this time around the band sounds as though they are pushing themselves even further. While _Evangelion_ is still recognizably (and perhaps even predictably) Behemoth, there’s a controlled chaos to the sound that gives things a certain energy. Opening track “Daimonos” starts with an unnecessary and clichéd sound insert of screams, barked threats, and general chaos, but thankfully it’s quite brief. The track doesn’t need it; its tone-setting ferocity allows it to speak on its own accomplished terms. From there it’s a gleefully bombastic journey, complete with Adam "Nergal" Darski’s expected vocals and cutting riffs and Zbigniew Robert "Inferno" Prominski’s pounding drums. Tomasz "Orion" Wróblewski’s bass is almost lost beneath the thundering guitar and drum duo, burying an extra layer of sound that could have only added more to the album. Lots of small touches abound — a soft outro here, a moment of pause there — and they only add to the fun. With _Evangelion_, Behemoth have released a familiar-sounding but nevertheless entertaining album that should be played just loud enough for the neighbors to hear.
