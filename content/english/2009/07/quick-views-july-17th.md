_By Sean Palmerston_

The following metal/hard rock reviews were published yesterday in Hamilton's VIEW Magazine and are not online, so I decided to throw them up on Hellbound...

**Deep Purple _History, Hits & Highlights ’68 – ’76_ DVD Eagle Vision**

Eagle Vision has done a pretty outstanding job with chronicling the history of Deep Purple over the years with historical DVD anthology releases but this might be the best yet. Great double disc set of television and live performances with that span the band’s first nine years. Cool to see the Rod Evans era band play ‘Hush’ on Playboy After Dark, but the real meat and potatoes comes from the Ian Gillan era, including a fantastic ‘Child In Time’.

Actually, I'd rather not play your game. It's even more miserable than your stint in Iced Earth was. It makes your time spent fronting Judas Priest seem like paradise. Thanks anyways.

**Dream Theater _Black Clouds & Silver Linings_ Roadrunner**

Longstanding progressive metal leaders stand still with a new record that's decent but brakes no new ground. More of the same, almost formulaic compared to their early years, one could almost guess the parts: ballad here, prog section then heavy section. Too bad these guys have been stuck in a rut since 1997. Not meant for new fans.

**Brutal Truth _Evolution Through Revolution_ Relapse**

Nice return to form by these NYC grindcore masters after more than a decade-long hiatus. Still one of the fiercest live outfits, this new platter showcases just how well new guitarist Erik Burke fits in. Well worth the wait.

**Subhumans _Worlds Apart_ Bluurg Records**

Originally released in the mid-80s, this was the crowning achievement from UK peace punks Subhumans. Now nicely remastered and available again in a fancy digipack (along with the rest of their 80s catalogue), this album still sounds as fantastic as it did as a teenager. Nostalgia worth revisiting indeed. [![review8](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/review8.png "review8")](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/review8.png)
