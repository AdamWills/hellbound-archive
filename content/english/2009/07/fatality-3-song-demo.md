Here is a three track demo release from Toronto’s FATALITY, a thrash metal band with plenty of aggressive, melodic technical hooks, blasting beats and soaring roaring vocals, complete with fast, intricate solos. As a demo this is executed with decent production, with a great deal of influence from bands like Metallica, Pantera, and Megadeth. The first track “no use for the living” starts with a real raw recording and a strong reflection of the thrash metal style of the 80s - not just in this track but in every track presented here.

Second track “FATALITY” has a quick intro of 1983’s SLAYER “Black Magic” in the middle of the track, which is a very cleverly done great piece of thrash metal. Last but least, the final song “Victims of the dead” has lots of backing vocals at the end of this track although truth be told it occasionally goes a bit overboard. This is a fairly solid demo which has a lot of killers riffs and solos.

Fatality is Spencer Le Von: Guitar/Vocals (this guy sounds a lot like Alice Cooper), Andro Suarez: Drums, Adam Zlotnik: Bass and Eytan Gordon: Lead Guitar. FATALITY is currently working on producing their first album. They are in the process of recording and aim to release it sometime this summer. It’s definitely worth to keep a close eye on this band.
