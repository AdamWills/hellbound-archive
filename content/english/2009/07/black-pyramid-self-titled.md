_By Gruesome Greg_

Easily the most coveted album amongst my shipment of MeteorCity new releases. Black Pyramid’s self-titled was one of my most anticipated albums of ’09, and easily my most eagerly awaited debut since the Blood Ceremony record that came out on Rise Above last year. I first heard of this  assachusetts-based trio via their 7” on Belgian label Electric Earth, whose owner was kind enough to send me a promo copy. (For what it’s worth, I named it my top EP of ’08 over at THTGIR…)

The A Side of said EP is a killer track called "Visions of Gehenna," which has been rightfully placed at the beginning of the album, following a two-minute instrumental buildup. The intro riff is one of those great slices of stoner doom riffery that belongs up on a pedestal with "Dragonaut" and "Return to Forever"—perhaps the second greatest song of ’08. The instrumental breakdown at the three-minute mark is a choice head-nodder. Hell, the whole song is one of those doomy numbers that makes you wanna bang yer head, not just nod it.

A couple songs (and one instrumental interlude later) we get Visions redux in "Twilight Grave," a song thick with heavy fuzz of the Cisneros/Pike variety. Although “stoner doom” is a term that gets tossed around a lot, I define it as meshing the slow, down-tempo pacing of Sabbath with the bluesy-riff rock of Kyuss, along with resin-stained hoarse vocals singing of mystical creatures and outer space. Sleep had this sound down to a T. So does Black Pyramid. Should the former’s reunion consist of more than a lone festival performance in the UK, MeteorCity should lobby aggressively for the latter to land the opening slot. I would certainly support this initiative.

Alas, while Black Pyramid self-titled isn’t quite _Holy Mountain Pt. 2_, it’s quite possibly the next best thing. If Sleep’s the stuff that makes your bongwater bubble, then Black Pyramid is your new favourite band. Doom’s not dead, not by a mile, and these guys are at the top of the list of New Doom Bands You Gotta Hear!
