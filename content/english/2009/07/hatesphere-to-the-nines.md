No matter the sub-genre, Scandinavian metal bands will always have a special place in my heart. There are many aspects of European metal that are so compelling. Proficient musicianship, gorgeous demeanors and signature vocals all contribute to a sound that is loved worldwide.

_To The Nines_ is the most recent release spawned by Dansk melodic death metallers’ Hatesphere. There is something about Hatesphere that separate them from all the rest. Though with all death and thrash elements combined, it’s not hard to compare Hatesphere to other bands.

A drum roll on title track “To The Nines” starts with pounding guitars and the intimidating vocals of Peter Lyse Hansen. Provocative track “Cloaked In Shit” brings an intense groove with a dulcet guitar solo. “Even If It Kills Me” is reminiscent of something off of The Haunted’s _Versus_ while maintaining a signature sound.

The short track “Commencing A Campaign” cuts the album in half, while slowly fading into the riff-driven “The Writing’s On The Wall”. Throughout the album, it is evident that Hatesphere try to keep tradition and a distinct sound. “Oceans Of Blood” screams metal to the max that begins in a thrash manner leading to extreme death mid-point to finally ending in guitar feedback that gives _To The Nines_ solid closure.

From beginning to end, Hatesphere truly deliver that classic Scandinavian metal sound while remaining to be unpredictable. While it is so easy to spot out influence from many bands we hear today, Hatesphere bring forth their own unique flavor to make enjoyable metal for anyone of any country.
