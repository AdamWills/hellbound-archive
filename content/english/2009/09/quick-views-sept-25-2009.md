The following metal/hard rock reviews were published yesterday in both Hamilton’s VIEW Magazine and Guelph's ECHO Weekly. While they are online, it is with a bunch of indie rock reviews so I decided to throw just the metal/hard rock-related ones up on Hellbound…

**Megadeth _Endgame_** _Endgame_ is the finest Megadeth album in more than 20 years. After the extreme disappointment of their last studio outing, another line up change occurred, bringing Jag Panzer’s Chris Broadrick on board to replace the departing Glenn Drover. I’m not sure if it was Broadrick’s addition that inspired Dave Mustaine or if he just had better songs this time around, but whatever the case may be this is the thrashiest, fiercest release to bear the Megadeth name in two decades and I like it a whole lot. You will too.

The vocals have more of a hint of black metal flavour to them than on previous releases, but the band writes such killer riffs that even if the vocals aren’t your thing these songs have enough balls to attract the more adventurous metal heads. Catch them this Friday in Kitchener when they open up for Children Of Bodom and The Black Dahlia Murder at Elements. The same bill plays Toronto's Sound Academy on Saturday. (Prosthetic)
