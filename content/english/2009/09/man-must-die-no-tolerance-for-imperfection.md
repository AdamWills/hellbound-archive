**By Albert Mansour**

This third full length album from Glasgow, Scotland's Man Must Die is an amazing listen from start to finish. Tracks such as “Gainsayer,” “Kill It Skin It Wear It,” “It Comes in Threes” and “This Day Is Black” feature awesome shredding guitar riffs, crazy hair-raising solos and some really sick, bone-chilling choking vocals. No Tolerance For Imperfection also takes some surprising turns with the all-instrumental “What I Can't Take Back” and the very technical “Survival of the Sickest” (I think that is the best way to describe it). Overall, this album is fantastic. I was honestly very skeptical at first, since it seemed like just another album from another death metal band. I was honestly wrong, and think that this album truly adds to the meaning of this genre. The best part of this CD is that every track has it own distinctive feel and it is not the same as the song you just listened to. I would recommend this album to anyone who is into [Amon Amarth](http://www.amazon.com/Amon-Amarth/e/B000APIBHO/ref=ntt_art_sim_1_1), Cryptopsy or Kataklysm. A very solid effort.
