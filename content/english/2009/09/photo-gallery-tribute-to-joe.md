If you've been to a metal show in Toronto at anytime in the past 20 years, chances are you know or have seen Joe. None of us from Hellbound.ca know Joe personally, but we have been seeing him at shows since Sepultura in 1991. He has a fierce admiration for metal and, although he doesn't have a computer, we asked him if we could take some pictures with him at Friday night's Obituary show in Toronto to post on Hellbound.ca and he said sure. Albert snapped some shots of Joe with Rob Kachluba, Blitz and I and also got another shot of him at Stryper on Sunday night too.

Ladies and gentleman, Joe, a true Toronto scene supporter!
