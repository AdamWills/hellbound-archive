Here's what the gang played on Hellbound Radio on Sunday night. All three were in attendance, as this was Kevin's last show before heading to Florida for vacation (have fun dude!). Sean drove Kevin crazy playing not one Â but two ANVIL songs, and also ended the show with a full 19-minute DREAM THEATER track.

Here's what we played...
