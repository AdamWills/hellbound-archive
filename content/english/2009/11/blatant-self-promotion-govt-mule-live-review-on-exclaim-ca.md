While Hellbound.ca is definitely my main focus these days, every now and then I still write for other places when asked. One band that I have covered for Exclaim! on a number of occasions that will appeal to some metal fans despite their non-metalness is the US based heavy blues rock quartet **Gov't Mule.** The last time I wrote about them was about seven years ago, but when I got a last minute offer to cover their recent Toronto performance last week for Exclaim!, I rang up Albert Mansour to see if he was interested in checking it out. We ended up with great seats in the third row and the band played a decent enough show, although to be honest the second half wasn't as good as the first.

If anyone would like to read the review, here is a link to it.
