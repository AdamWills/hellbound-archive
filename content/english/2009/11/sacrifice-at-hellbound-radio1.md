On Sunday, November 15th Hellbound Radio played host to some special guests when the entire line up of the recently re-activated **Sacrifice** graced us with their presence. The legendary Toronto thrashers came down the QEW to Hamilton and hung with us in the Indi 101 studios, so we in turn dedicated the entire three hour show to the band's career.

We spent the better part of 180 minutes talking about the history of the band, playing music from all four albums that contain the four original members of the band, including their brand new album _The Ones I Condemn_, which Hellbound.ca's own Rob Kachluba gave a perfect 10 out of 10 rating to recently on this very website.

With the band playing their Toronto CD release show this Saturday at Toronto's Opera House, we thought we'd make some video available from the radio show this past Sunday. Here is the first part of the interview with the band, dealing with the band's origins and their debut album _Torment In Fire_.

The band is interviewed in this segment by Sean Palmerston and the video footage was filmed by Albert Mansour and Adam Wills. All editing and production on the video was done by Adam Wills.
