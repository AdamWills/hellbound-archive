Hey, Hellbound.ca has been nominated for an award! We've been nominated for Best Website/Online Publication Of The Year in the 2009 Hamilton Music Awards, which is taking place next weekend here in Hamilton, ON, Canada.

We're up against three other online publications, all of which cover music to some degree, but we are definitely the only underground metal publication - and we probably have the widest worldwide reach (at least according to our stats, which show vsitors regularly from Europe, Australia and even some recently from Egypt and Iran), but honestly I'm delighted to see we're getting some hometown recognition even if we don't win the award.

Of course, if we do you'll know about it. We'll make sure everybody knows! You can find out more about the whole deal at [http://www.hamiltonmusicawards.com/industry.html](http://www.hamiltonmusicawards.com/industry.html)

Cheers,

Sean Palmerston
