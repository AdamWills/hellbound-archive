On Sunday, November 15th Hellbound Radio played host to some special guests when the entire line up of the recently re-activated **Sacrifice** graced us with their presence. The legendary Toronto thrashers came down the QEW to Hamilton and hung with us in the Indi 101 studios, so we in turn dedicated the entire three hour show to the bandâ€™s career.

Here are the final two parts of the interview, in which the band answers some listeners questions, talks about the new album, the show this weekend in Toronto and the upcoming vinyl reissues due out in 2010.

Interview by Sean Palmerston, camera work by Adam Wills and Albert Mansour and all editing by Adam Wills.
