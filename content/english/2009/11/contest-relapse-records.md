Like to win things? Looking to add a little more quality metal to your collection just before Christmas? Yeah, us too! Well, courtesy of the fine folks over at **Relapse Records**, Hellbound.ca has three (3) fantastic Relapse Records holiday gift packs to give away containing the following four albums: **[Baroness -_Blue Record_](http://www.hellbound.ca/2009/10/baroness-blue-record/) [Revocation - _Existence Is Futile_](http://www.hellbound.ca/2009/10/revocation-existence-is-futile/) [Black Anvil - _Time Insults The Mind_](http://www.hellbound.ca/2009/09/black-anvil-time-insults-the-mind/) [Dying Fetus - _Descend Into Depravity_](http://www.hellbound.ca/2009/08/dying-fetus-descend-into-depravity/)**
