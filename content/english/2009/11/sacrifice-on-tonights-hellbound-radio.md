Legendary Toronto thrashers **SACRIFICE** will be interviewed live on tonight's November 15th edition of Hellbound Radio on INDI 101. All four members of the band will be present for the interview, which will air live in the greater Hamilton ON area at 9 PM Eastern on 101.5 FM. Those not in the area can also listen to the show online at [http://www.indifm.ca](http://www.indifm.ca/) or [http://radiotime.com/station/s\_24659/C1015\_FM.aspx](http://radiotime.com/station/s_24659/C1015_FM.aspx) .

SACRIFICE will be talking about their career, their new album and their upcoming Toronto CD release show, which happens next Saturday, November 21st at The Opera House in Toronto with support groups E-FORCE, MAXIMUM RnR and SPEWGORE. This is the band's final performance of the year; SACRIFICE also played a packed show last weekend with PROPAGANDHI at the Garrick Centre in Winnipeg MB.
