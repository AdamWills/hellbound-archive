**Photos and Words by Sean Palmerston**

Hellbound.ca contributor and long time metal collector Rob Kachluba and his wife recently moved into a brand new home somewhere on the outskirts of the Ontario city that most of us Hellbounders call home. The move had been in the works for some time, but Rob finally agreed to go through with it when his wife agreed he could take over most of the basement to become his metal shrine.

In their previous house, Mr. Kachluba had a nice little room to display his limited edition mailorder boxed set, picture disc LPs, CD collection and vast button collection, but in the new Chez Kachluba this lucky fellow has nearly the entire basement in a huge L shaped room - most of which is dedicated to his love of metal. The rest of the shrine also contains a projection television and kick ass surround sound system, on which Rob, Albert and I took in a viewing of the amazing-in-its-own-right _Anvil: The Story Of Anvil_ DVD.

Rob gave me permission to take some photos of the Kachluba Metal Shrine and post some of them here on Hellbound.ca, so please enjoy this sneak peak at a small part of what is his pride and joy.
