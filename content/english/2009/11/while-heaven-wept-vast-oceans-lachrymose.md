**By Rob Kachluba**

Let me just start by saying that the song "Vessel" on the new While Heaven Wept CD is in my opinion the most emotionally charged melodic masterpiece of 2009. The melody in the chorus is pure goosebumps and tear action. Vocalist Rain Irving just shines on this whole CD. He has the highs but never goes into an overly gay falsetto; instead he just sings with pure passion. This band is labeled doom but there so much more then that. Think melodic, atmospheric, sorrow-filled prog doom but with uplifting dynamics. Strange to mentioned uplifting the description of a doom band. Album track "To Wander The Void" is pure John Arch/Fates Warning worship but who doesn't want to hear that. Rain does a perfect job of emulating John Arch; his unique vocal delivery in the versesÂ  clearly demonstrates he is just a superb vocalist. Just go ahead and listen. You will be in heaven. The only real downfall to this CD is it contains six tracks but only four proper tracks as two are intros/instrumentals. If you want to hear passionate music played by dedicated musicians that have been reworked and reworked again and again into perfection (some of the tracks go back as far as 95), the final results are proof that this will be one of my absolute faves of 09 and possibly one of the greatest melodic doom metal albums of our time.
