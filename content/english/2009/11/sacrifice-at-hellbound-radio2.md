[![SACRIFICE 109ab](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/SACRIFICE-109ab-300x200.jpg "SACRIFICE 109ab")](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/SACRIFICE-109ab.jpg)

On Sunday, November 15th Hellbound Radio played host to some special guests when the entire line up of the recently re-activated **Sacrifice** graced us with their presence. The legendary Toronto thrashers came down the QEW to Hamilton and hung with us in the Indi 101 studios, so we in turn dedicated the entire three hour show to the band's career.

In the second part of our interview with **Sacrifice**, the band discusses the _Soldiers of Misfortune_ album, recording at Phase One Studios, their stance on bootlegs recordings, their upcoming live concert DVD (!!!) and more.

The band is interviewed by Sean Palmerston and the video footage was filmed by Albert Mansour and Adam Wills. All editing and production on the video was done by Adam Wills. Tune in next time for Part 3
