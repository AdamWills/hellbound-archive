Announcing HELLBOUND's first ever contest!

We have 2 copies of **AUGURY**'s brand new album **_Fragmentary Evidence_** that were autographed by all four members of the band on Saturday night just hours after their very successful hometown CD launch at Montreal's Club Soda.Â  The band were nice enough to sign a few copies for us and they are now yours to win.

In order to enter, please send an email to seanp at hellbound.ca with the subject line AUGURY CONTEST and answer the following question:

What city does AUGURY call home? (Quick hint, it's mentioned elsewhere on this page).

Deadline to enter is this Saturday, August 22nd at Midnight eastern time

Good luck!
