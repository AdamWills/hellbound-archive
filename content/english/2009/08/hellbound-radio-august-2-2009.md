Ladies and germs, here is the playlist for this past Sunday's edition of Hellbound Radio. This week we had our youngest guest yet. Sean's older son Kieran (age six) rode shotgun with us (although for most of the taping he was playing games on [www.tvokids.com](http://www.tvokids.com)). While young Mr. Palmerston isn't really a fan of metal, when asked what he thought of the show Kieran said it was awesome.

Here's this week's playlist.
