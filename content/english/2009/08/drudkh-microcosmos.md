_By Laura Wiebe Taylor_ _Microcosmos_, the latest record from elusive Ukrainians Drudkh, has been hailed by many fans as the band’s return to folkish black metal form. The album is teasingly short – four full songs in the middle with a brief folk instrumental at either end. The serious substance lies in those four lengthy central tracks – raw blackened aggression, potently emotional melodies, uneasy acoustic interludes, pulsing riffs, atmospheric drones, and a handful of unsettling heavy metal solos. The music’s elemental qualities are arranged in a tense ever-shifting balance, flowing from one riff, one lead, one song to the next, then sometimes taking an abrupt change in direction. The bass plays a prominent role in the sonic and compositional mix, providing a reverberating counterpoint to higher-pitched leads and an essential weight anchoring the album’s melodic meanderings to the rhythmic momentum underneath. _Microcosmos_ is Drudkh’s first album for Season of Mist, but it carries no compromises for a potentially larger audience – Drudkh remains rewarding but also difficult. Their newest record is sophistication without veneer, a visceral and kaleidoscopic brew.
