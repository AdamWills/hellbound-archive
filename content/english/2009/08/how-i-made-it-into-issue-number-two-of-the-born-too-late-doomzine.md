![Gruesome Greg's Top 10 Doom Albums](http://www.hellbound.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0168-300x224.jpg)

So, last Tuesday I was checking my emails before calling it a nite, when I noticed a message from John Gallo via the Hellride Music Forum.  He said he wanted my Top 10 doom metal albums for issue number 2 of his zine, and that he had to have it by the end of the day.  Reading this after 11pm, I had to come up with something on the spot, and the list above is the result.  I didn't actually write it up on a scrap of paper and FedEx it to Rochester, but I must say that I like the way it looks on the back page.

In hindsight, there were probably a couple bands I left out (Vitus, Trouble) and perhaps an album or two that doesn't belong, as much as I dig that new Black Pyramid record.  I completely stand by my pick of Sleep's _Holy Mountain_ in the top spot, however.  One of my all-time favourite albums, regardless of subgenre.  Did I mention that OM is coming to Toronto on October 9th?  Too bad that Al doesn't have Chris Hakius with him anymore--or Matt Pike, for that matter--but I'm still looking forward to it.  Anyways, now that my list is a part of this site, it's probably just a matter of time before I submit some of these classic album reviews that Sean's been asking for the past couple weeks.  In case you missed it, my [Black Pyramid review](http://www.hellbound.ca/2009/07/black-pyramid-self-titled/) was posted a little while back.  Instant classic, in my books.

For those of you who were wondering how the fest in Rochester went, I did a writeup and posted some pics over at [THTGIR](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/reviews/concerts/borntoolate.html).  I'll see y'all (or at least some of ya) at the Wreckroom tonite for Gates of Slumber, Zoroaster and Serpentcult.

Peace,

Greg
