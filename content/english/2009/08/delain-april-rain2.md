_By Albert Mansour_

Netherlands-based Delain's second full length album offers twelve new tracks, featuring some interesting drum and bass patterns scattered throughout the entire album along with atmospheric keyboard sections placed studiously in songs like “Control the Storm,” “Go Away” and the title track. The only problem here is a minor one: it is the simple fact that it is not as adventurous as many other gothic metal albums. Instead, this is a very commercial endeavour that could almost pass as a dance album, but that’s not too big of a problem. The vocals are perfect. They always match the music dead on. Unlike most female goth metal, Charlotte Wessels does not sound over dramatic. Her performance grabs the listener and does not let go until the album's completion. However, this album does not strictly rely on vocals like most female-fronted goth metal acts; it also gives the listener a good dose of instrumental sections as well. To sum it all up, if you’re into bands such as Lacuna Coil, Within Temptation and The Gathering you must own a copy of April Rain. Fans of Nightwish should also be aware that the album features Marco Hietala from Nightwish on two tracks. This album takes its building blocks of those bands and with it build something much more interesting. Delain has created something amazing that will live on forever in the heavy metal world.
