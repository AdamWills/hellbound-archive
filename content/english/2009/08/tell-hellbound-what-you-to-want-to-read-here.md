Hey HELLBOUND readers!

I wanted to make a quick post to ask you, the readers of this site, to provide us some input on what you would like to see on these here pages in the next little while.

Things are moving fast and furiously over here at HELLBOUND HQ, with new albums appearing daily in the mail for review and more interview opportunities than ever being thrown our way. We have a lot of cool stuff coming down the pipeline in the days, weeks and months to come that span the gamut of metal and we hope that you will continue to enjoy reading our coverage just as much as we have enjoyed creating it.

However, I wanted to throw a word out to our readership to see if there are bands/albums/scenes that you'd like to see us cover here at hellbound.ca. There are literally hundred of metal albums coming out each month and while we would like to cover them all, unfortunately we can't get to them all - or in some cases haven't even been sent that vital album you've been waiting for us to cover.

Since you the readers arethe lifeblood of Hellbound, I am asking you to take the time to make a comment after this article and let us know what you want to see. Are there certain artists you want us to interview? Would you like to see more blogs being written by our contributors? Do you think we don't do enough live reviews or vinyl reviews? Is there not enough power metal coverage on the site? Would you like to see more demo reviews? Whatever it is, please let us know, either by leaving a comment or by writing me a personal email (look for the address by clicking the ABOUT button on the main page).

Thanks as always and if you're in the Hamilton area this Saturday, make sure to make it down to Hamilton's Casbah for the HAMMERS OF MISFORTUNE/LUDICRA show. Doors open at 10 and it should be pretty easy to find some of the Hellbound staff by the bar.

Regards,

Sean Palmerston
