_By Jonathan Smith_

Norway’s Throne of Katarsis have produced a sophomore full-length album that is, in almost every way, a recreation of much of the early nineties Norwegian black metal sound. Harsh shrieking vocals that skate over icy riffs and echoing chord progressions are central to _Helvete - Det Iskalde Mørket_’s sound, and it is complemented by production that is fittingly minimalist. The mixture of nature and satanic imagery invoked here is par for the course, but the epic title track is a spine-tingling mixture of all the elements that can make the genre so musically satisfying. It’s all been done before — there’s little that is ground-breaking to be found here. However, far from being a drawback, the familiarity of the sound is the album’s central strength. It is a purposeful return to a certain sonic tradition and should be approached as such. In terms of its sheer wintery bleakness, _Helvete - Det Iskalde Mørket_ is well worth a listen.
