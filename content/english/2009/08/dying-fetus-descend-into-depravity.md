**By Matt Lewis** Plagued with lineup changes throughout the years Dying Fetus is back to old form and they definitely “bring it.” What do I mean by “bring it”? I mean death metal with its technical wizardry and the grooviest death metal this side of hell. After Jason Netherton left the band to work full time on Misery Index, John continued on with an almost entirely new lineup. While _Stop At Nothing_ was weak, tired and dare I say boring, _War of Attrition_ was a turn around and this new effort in _Descend into Depravity_ has the band playing for keeps. Production was a sore spot on the last record, especially the drums but this time the drums are crisp, clean and punchy. After the opening riff from the first track “Your Treachery Will Die With You” and John’s guttural vocal style I knew this was going to be the Dying Fetus I’ve loved since _Killing on Adrenaline_. Bass player and vocalist Sean Beasley has stepped right in to the role and does a great job complimenting John’s grunts and growls. The breakdowns are so damn catchy I turned a baseball cap sideways and slammed danced by myself, right into a wall. My cat looked at me funny. Punishing, ripping, head snapping and brutal in the best way, all words to describe this album.
