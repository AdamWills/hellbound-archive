_By Ola Mazzuca_

Ex-e-crate: verb: to feel or express great loathing for. That is not my initial feeling, but it comes pretty close seeing that this is the first time that I have had an aversion to music hailing from Norway.

Oslo’s Execration create death metal that is both rigorous and exhausting.

_Syndicate of Lethargy_ is their latest release in which they unleash a heavy, brutal, vintage sound that is also very bland. This is a good example of ‘meat and potatoes’ death metal that does not venture very far.

The album begins with “Fleshfire”, scoring one point for good percussion skills. “Disciples Of The Suffering” and “Kuroi Kiri” led me to conclude that all tracks are starting to sound alike, with no contrast or interesting highlights. It is evident that you’re not meant to decipher lyrics in death metal, but come on, isn’t this taking it a little too far?

“Voracious” is a track that lives up to its name being very eager and intense. Execration later pull a Carcass move by adding an evangelistic narrative at the beginning of “Submission To Falsities”, while the dull, doom infused “Clinging To Existence” closes _Syndicate Of Lethargy_.

Overall, I must admit that I am disappointed in these Norwegians. Maybe this is due to the fact that I love colour and variety in death metal, may it be old school, technical or melodic. I hear and understand the sound they strive for, but old school doesn’t necessarily mean sloppy.
