_(This was originally reviewed for METAL MANIACS as a CD review. Since then, it has been issued as a vinyl 7" boxed set by Relapse that is truly incredible. It makes this an even better listening experience.)_

**By Sean Palmerston**

_Alright! Fourteen bands. Fifty-one song compilation. Fifty-seven minutes of intensity. You absolutely need this one. First new Brutal Truth in years. What in the hell you waiting for? Spoonful Of Vicodin's titles are longer than songs. Chainsaw To The Face: definitely toughest band name here. Agents Of Satan have unreadable fonts plus Paul Baloff tribute. Shitstorm deliver absolutely no tunes longer than one minute. Compiled by Scott Hull, dude from Pig Destroyer. This is a super heavy-duty musical smorgasbord. From political to straight ahead grind. Total Fucking Destruction's best yet. Final Insect Warfare songs. Maruta's contribution rules. Highly recommended. Wow! (Relapse)_
