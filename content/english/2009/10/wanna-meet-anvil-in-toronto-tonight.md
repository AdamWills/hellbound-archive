I don't usually post these kinda things, but since I do dig our underground Ontario metal heroes Anvil and fully support them during their return to mainstream noteriety I thought I'd share this:

October 28th with Anvil at The Hard Rock Café in Toronto

TORONTO - This Wednesday Live Nation gives fans ultimate access Anvil. For one day fans will be given the chance to meet the band and buy a ticket to their upcoming concert with no service fees.

**WHEN**:  Wednesday, October 28th from 5-7pm

**WHAT**:  “Ultimate Access Wednesday”

\-  Come down to hang out with Anvil

\-  Purchase a $20 ticket to their upcoming concert on **January 8****th** **at The Phoenix Concert Theatre** with no service fee.

**WHERE**: Hard Rock Cafe Toronto, 279 Yonge St. at Yonge and Dundas Square

Toronto’s **Anvil** was one of the first North American bands to push the sound and style of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal one step further. Clearly indebted to the likes of [Judas Priest](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kifrxqe5ldse), [Iron Maiden](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3ifyxqe5ldae), and many others from across the Atlantic, **Anvil** nonetheless played louder, faster, and heavier than their heroes, in the process laying the groundwork for the thrash movement that took over heavy metal's underground in the '80s.

The band's history has been documented in the film [_Anvil! The Story of Anvil_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anvil%21_The_Story_of_Anvil) released this week. The film has received high praise which has put **Anvil** back into the public consciousness, propelling them to playing several festivals including the [Download Festival in 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_Festival) at which they headlined the [Tuborg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuborg) stage. [Rolling Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone) called the movie "the year’s most praised rock doc.”

Don’t miss **Anvil** when they perform on **January 8****th** **at The Phoenix Concert Theatre** in Toronto. Regular priced tickets are on sale now for $25 (including GST, plus service fees) at [www.livenation.com](http://www.livenation.com/) and all Ticketmaster Outlets. This show is 19+, general admission.
