[](../2009/10/blatant-self-promotion-obituary-live-review-on-exclaim-ca/ "Permanent Link to Blatant Self-Promotion: Obituary Live Review on Exclaim.ca")While Hellbound.ca is definitely my main focus these days, every now and then I still write for other places when asked. Way back before I launched Hellbound.ca back on June 1st, a Toronto date for **Porcupine Tree** and **King's X** was announced in Toronto for September 30th and I pitched Exclaim! on doing a review of it. True to my word, I went to the show and did the review for Exclaim!, who have posted it up online this morning.

So, if anyone would like to read the review, here is a link to it.
