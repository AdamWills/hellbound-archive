While Hellbound.ca is definitely my main focus these days, every now and then I still write for other places when asked. Exclaim! put out a call last Friday looking for someone to review that night's Obituary show in Toronto, which I was going to cover for Hellbound.ca with a full review, so I wrote up a review for Exclaim! instead. They published it online yesterday, so if anyone is interested in reading it then please follow the link below to check it out:
