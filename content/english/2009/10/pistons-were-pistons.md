**By Albert Mansour** Punk rock Italians Pistons recorded this ten-track album, which sounds like a cross between vintage Sex Pistols and the modern version of Motorhead, in nine hours but I wish they had spent more time, or recorded more songs. This 21 minute CD would have worked better if it was doubled in size. It flew by in record time, songs that are 1 – 3 minutes long are a little too short. There's really nothing wrong with that, but in my opinion it is just way too short. . First track “Intro” is a real mystery to me. The album does not really necessarily need a 57 second intro for such a tiny album, although the track does remind me of“Ace of Spades.” It is a very close tribute. Seriously impressive! Elsewhere throughout this debut album are many surprises. I love the way they used crude mixing ideas on tracks like “Betoniars,” “Sons of Bastards” and “Rock “n” roll Creatures.” I’ve never heard any punk bands coming out of Italy over the years but this album is just a little rough on the edges, sounding like a demo tape from a garage band, but I dig that. For the other moments, some parts show the pure influence of Lemmy's vocals, which are a great thing - a blend of punk rock and heavy metal. But I have to admit _We’re Pistons_ is a pretty damn raw recording. Many tracks are kind of choppy pieces from beginning to end, but there are also some very original touches. To the mainstream punk rock fans out there these days this album will come out without a dull moment, as the riffs are very nicely arranged, yet I find myself slightly disappointed. _We're Pistons_ is a little sloppy for a first-effort album. This was made in a half a day and I thought the album blazed by way too fast. I hope they slow things down a little bit next time out.
