_**By Kevin Stewart-Panko**_

**Agoraphobic Nosebleed** has just released their crowning achievement, the stunningly song-oriented ginormous musical fuck-stick that is _**Agorapocalypse**_ and as the press cycle dictates, it’s time for them to do interviews promoting said record. We could ask about their packaging the CD in old-school longboxes, what took so fucking long and how a band that doesn’t have a drummer managed to place a drum solo in “**Question of Integrity**.” We could also ask about Jay Randall and Katherine Katz’s lyrical ire. Maybe we’d get normal answers, maybe we wouldn’t, but this is the same band that gave the world _Frozen Corpse Stuffed With Dope_ and has songs about being “Nose deep in Jamaican armpit pussy” and “Prepubescent boys with handsome white asses.” Things don’t exactly fall into line ‘round these parts. While everyone else worried and wondered about all that other shit, Hellbound.ca decided conventionally interviewing a gang of misanthropic jokers like ANb was probably going to get us nowhere. So, we cornered all four members and subjected them to time honored party game and one of the last surviving bastions of Freudian psychology: word association. You know the drill, see a word, say the first thing that comes to mind. Analyze their answers at your own discretion.
