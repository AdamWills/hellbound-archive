_By Jay Siebert_

I'll be honest, even though I am a big fan of Norwegian metal in general, Norwegian black metal especially, I haven't really cared for anything Satyricon has done since _Rebel Extravaganza_. The whole "black 'n' roll" thing they haveÂ  adopted really makes my stomach turn... but there's something about this record I really dig.

I know I can feel flames coming when I say this, but the old vibe this record gives is pretty damn pleasing to the ears. With obvious new elements mixed in and a pretty slick production - it was recorded at Sound Studios in Van Nuys, California where Metallica recorded _Death Magnetic_ - you'll be surprised to hear that this album still sounds dirty and mean in this humble reviewer's opinion.

One of the things you'll notice right off is Frost's drumming on this record: he really seems have to locked in with this guitars this time around and almost everything played fits very well. _The Age Of Nero_ teems with groove and melody which will keep your foot tapping through out. Once again co-written by the infamous Snorre Ruch of Thorns fame, this album did not disappoint.

Is it old Satyricon? No... definitely not. I had personally given up on them a long time ago, but curiosity always gets the best of me and in this case it has payed off. The album is available domestically in North America as a single disc but collectors will want to search out the limited European two disc version on Roadrunner Europe. Choose your weapon and one more thing... the close minded need not apply.
