_By Keith Carman_

Raspy and ravenous, Germany's Minotaur have been belting out blackened thrash metal since the early 1980s. However, unlike cohorts such as Kreator and Sodom, this power trio slipped between the cracks, never receiving the same degree of recognition. Like true lifers though, they undauntedly continue to fight for thrash metal's cause with latest full-length _God may show you mercy...we will not_. Their first effort in two decades, this 11-track affair boasts a malicious onslaught of chunky guitar riffs, double-time beats and scorching vocal attack. Still, while it fits perfectly amongst mid-'80s European thrash, there is a degree of innovation that is lacking overall. The end result is strong but mediocre, feeling as though we've heard all of this before, occasionally on better terms. In a pinch, _God may show you mercy...we will not_ suffices to fill the need for expedient metal but it is far from providing a substantial diet.
