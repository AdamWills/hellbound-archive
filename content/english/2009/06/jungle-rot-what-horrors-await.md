_By Albert Mansour_

Back with their sixth full length CD is this old school death metal band which emerged in the mid '90’s. There is an undeniable influence of Slayer, Sodom and Obituary on this band from Kenosha, Wisconsin; this album is by far is a lot tighter than other albums I’ve purchased by them in the past. From start to finish _What Horrors Await_ roars and screams metal throughout its fourteen tracks. Great lyrical themes of war, torture and death in songs like "Nerve Gas Catastrophe," "State Of War" and "Exit Wounds" plus there is an added bonus cover of the classic 1985 Destruction track of Destruction’s "Invincible Force" off their _Infernal Overkill_ album that is very well done. I find this their most impressive and destructive release yet. Everything has improved over the years with Jungle Rot, including the artwork, this time by Gyula Hauancsak (Destruction, Grave Digger, Stratovarius ) and the recording, handled by recording engineer Chris Djuricic (Fleshgrind, November’s Doom). If I had one complaint, it would be that lots of songs sound the same. It's just fortunate that said song sounds good.
