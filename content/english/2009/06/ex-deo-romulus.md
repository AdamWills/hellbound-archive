_By Mark Coatsworth_

Brutal, crushing, epic metal to the march of Roman legions! With their debut _Romulus_, Ex Deo establishes a unique middle ground between the fierce brutality of Kataklysm and the storming pagan metal of Blackguard, Moonsorrow and Tyr. In ten tracks, _Romulus_ recounts the history of the Ancient Romans, from the first struggle between wolf-bred brothers, “Romulus and Remus,” to the plunder of Rome and final collapse of the Empire. Song structures are unique and varied, tempos range from slow and brooding to full-frontal assault, twisting and turning through the wars, victories, defeats, ascension and collapse. Guitars pound forward to a rhythmic march and Maurizio's vocals are powerful and commanding without sacrificing clarity or focus. _Romulus_ is a welcome addition to the pagan metal catalogue, with a refreshing musical approach that trades keyboard solos for blastbeats, chants for guttural growls and Vikings for Roman legions. All without forfeiting the slightest bit of grandiosity.
