Ottawa, ON’s **BURIED INSIDE** has announced a cross-Canada tour in support of their brand new album **_Spoils Of Failure_** and HELLBOUND is proud to announce we have been asked to co-sponsor the tour along with the fine folks over at Lambgoat.com. **BURIED INSIDE** will first head west across Canada starting July 1st for a three-week run that will also include Winnipeg's finest band since KITTENS, **KEN MODE**, on select dates, as well as a stint down into the States to take part in Dudefest 2009 in Indianapolis, IN. **BURIED INSIDE** will then head back out in late August for a second leg, covering the eastern most Canadian provinces. A complete listing of these Lambgoat.com and Hellbound.ca sponsored tour dates can be found below with more details to be announced soon.
