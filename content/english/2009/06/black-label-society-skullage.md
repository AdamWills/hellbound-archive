_By Matt Lewis_

Zakk Wylde. The man, the guitar hero, the biker, the virtuoso….what the hell happened? _Skullage_ is a “greatest hits”, starting from his Pride and Glory days all the way to his latest works, including previously unreleased acoustic arrangements of various songs. It starts with the good old days, “Machine Gun Man” from _Pride and Glory_ and “Dead As Yesterday” from _Book of Shadows_. It progresses in chronological order so it makes the flow of the album a little uneven. I’ve been a fan of Zakk since I started listening to metal. His early work with Ozzy, his solo debut with _Book of Shadows_ and his first two albums under the “BLS” name with _Sonic Brew_ and _Stronger Than Death_. They were all fantastic records. In his pre-biker days, Zakk always found a way to be different album to album. _Pride and Glory_ was nothing like _Book of Shadows_, my favorite album by Zakk, even the first 3 “BLS” had a little something different. Since _The Blessed Hellride_, Zakk has found a formula that he likes and has not really deviated from it, save _Hangover Music Vol.6_. This is disappointing to say the least and it shows as _Skullage_ progresses. Halfway through till the acoustic tracks it’s all the same: riff, riff, harmonic signature, solo. For a guy who can blaze the guitar and amaze any guitarist he’s lost his ingenuity and pizzazz. Zakk: put down the electric, pick up the acoustic for a couple albums and for the love of god lose the southern style vocals. You were born in New Jersey, not Birmingham, Alabama.
