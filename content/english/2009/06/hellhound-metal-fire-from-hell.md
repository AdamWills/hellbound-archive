_By Jonathan Smith_

_Metal Fire From Hell_ is the second album from Japan’s Hellhound. It doesn’t offer anything off the beaten path, but there is no indication that the band has any intention of suggesting otherwise. The music is very much rooted in a thick stew of classic metal influences, and everything, even down to the song titles and themes, alludes to a great love for and appreciation of those who have come before. With tracks with names like “Heavy Metal Education,” “Metal Psycho,”and “Too Wild To Tame,” it’s clear that subtlety does not exist with regard to _Metal Fire From Hell_. It’s a solid and amusing collection, however, and things get better as the album progresses. The final piece, “Warriors of Rising Sun,” opens with an absolutely infectious sliding guitar sound in which the spirit of the entire album is captured. As a whole this offering from Hellhound is, simply put, just plain ol’ fun.
