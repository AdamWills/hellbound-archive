_**By Albert Mansour**_

This four track demo EP is pure 80's metal. It sounds to me like the early output of Scotland's Heavy Pettin' fronted by a singer that sounds somewhat similar to Kevin Griffiths of the NWOBHM band Briar. My favourite song here is "Wanted Dead," a solid metal tune that would have fit well on Riot's classic Narita album. One of the better demos I have stumbled upon in recent times, this Chicago-based band shows a lot potential for future releases. This recording sounds like it was done in analog mode instead of digital, which gives a real 80's style feel that fits well. While I dig the music, I find the packaging of this demo a bit sloppy. The front and back covers have no art work, pictures, details on the band, no web page info - nothing. There is very little on their myspace too. Some fine tuning needs to take place for this band's appearance, but their musical direction is a cool one. You can check some of the demo tracks out online at their myspace, listed below.
