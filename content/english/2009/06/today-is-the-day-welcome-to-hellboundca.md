Today is indeed the day! Thanks for joining us for the launch of _Hellbound.ca_, Canada's newest metal webzine. Updated weekdays with 2 - 3 new album reviews, concert reviews and photos as well as in-depth interviews with bands that span the realm of underground metal, Hellbound hopes to fill part of the void left with the unfortunate recent closings of Unrestrained!, Metal Edge and Metal Maniacs.

After the death of my friend Adrian Bromley last year, his long-running Unrestrained! Magazine was put into permanent hiatus. Only a few months later, my main metal writing outlet Metal Maniacs was also put into retirement by its publishers. On the urging of my wife and friends I've decided to start up my own daily metal webzine, named Hellbound, as a tie-in to the weekly Hellbound Radio show I do Sundays with my good friend Kevin Stewart-Panko.

I've assembled a talented staff of some of my favourite Canadian metal writers, including some names you may know (Kevin Stewart-Panko, Adrien Begrand, Laura Wiebe Taylor, Laina Dawes and former U! editor Tate Bengston, plus photographer Mark Coatsworth) as well as a bunch of longtime scene supporters that have never written before but know their metal inside out.

It is my hope to try and bring another new outlet into the world of metal that will support both the local Canadian scene and the international metal underground. Please spread the word if you can, take a peek now and come visit us regularly.Here is just some of what you can expect to see in the coming days and weeks.

Confirmed interviews in the month of June include: AGORAPHOBIC NOSEBLEED - check it on the site now! FATALIST IRONSWORD (a second interview on top of the one already in the archives) SAROS Shadow Kingdom Records label profile TANK - read it June 2nd! VIKING SKULL

Confirmed live reviews in the month of June include: NAPALM DEATH/TOXIC HOLOCAUST/KATAKLYSM/COLISEUM/TRAP THEM WOLVES IN THE THRONE ROOM/KRALLICE/A STORM OF LIGHT WOODS OF YPRES/MUSK OX/ELEVATOR 22 TESTAMENT/UNEARTH/LAZARUS A.D. MARYLAND DEATH FEST 2009 TOXIC HOLOCAUST/CAULDRON HEAVY MTL FEST 2008

New album reviews posted every weekday starting today. Everything from the major new releases of the day to underground demo reviews. Make sure to bookmark our site as one of your regular stops and please do leave us comments on the articles and reviews. This is a site written by fans for fans about what we all love most - metal!

I hope you enjoy reading this site as much as I have enjoyed pulling it together.

Regards,

Sean Palmerston
