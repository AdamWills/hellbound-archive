I met Keith back in 1998 when he did a story on an anniversary party on the label I was working at. Over the years we always run into each other at shows, either as spectators or, in Keith's case, performers. Keith has written for a bunch of different places in Canada, including Chart and Exclaim!, and also plays guitar in Toronto's Maximum R n R, a great thrash-punk band that you all should check out. I'm glad to have him aboard the good ship Hellbound when he has the time!

**Name and Location:** Keith Carman, Toronto, Ontario **How did you start writing for Hellbound?** At the offering of our great Editor In Chief!

**What’s your favorite piece published during Hellbound’s two years?** Birth A.D. It was a simple q and a but the band is amazing and hopefully people picked up on them because of it. **What are some of your best concert memories?** Seeing both Carcass and Sacrifice reunite...but not suck; Frank Black's first solo tour. **Black metal, death metal or grind?** Grind.

**Person you’d like to interview but it hasn’t happened…** **Hank Von Helvete** from **Turbonegro**. **The most underrated metal album is:** Alice Cooper: _Raise Your Fist And Yell_. His heaviest work and the tour was bloody! **You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?** Motorhead: _No Remorse_ Slayer: _Reign In Blood_ Suicidal Tendencies: _How Will I Laugh..._ Misfits: _Collection One_ D.R.I.: _Dealing With It_ Yeah, some aren't "metal" but they're crucial to metal's evolution.
