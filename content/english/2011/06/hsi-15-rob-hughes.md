When I first started contacting writers for Hellbound, there were a number of former Unrestrained! scribes that I had hoped to have contribute to the new site. Rob Hughes was one of those people. Looking back this is quite silly to admit, but I was intimidated to contact Rob because I had read all of the great reviews and interviews he had done for U!, plus I knew that he had copy-edited some of the stuff I had written for that magazine. I procrastinated on doing so, but in the meantime Rob got a hold of me and I am so glad he did. I consider Mr. Hughes to be our progressive guru, a term he may find slightly disconcerting but it is meant at the highest level of compliment.

**How did you start writing for Hellbound?** I guess it started way back with Unrestrained! magazine, for which I worked as a copyeditor and contributing writer for nearly 10 years. After Adrian Bromley’s sudden passing and the magazine’s demise, I was heartbroken and at a bit of a loss. I still had my blog, of course, but I missed being a part of a team. When Hellbound started up, I recognized some of the people involved as ex-Unrestrained! staffers; namely Kevin, Tate, Laura and Jay Gorania. Jay was the one who initially encouraged/pestered me (via Facebook chat) to get involved. So I got in touch with Sean about covering the Noctis Festival and Metal Conference in Calgary, and that pitch got me my first two articles for Hellbound. I’m proud to be a part of something that I think is carrying on Adrian’s spirit—an enthusiasm for music (especially Canadian music) that might not get a fair shot anywhere else.

**What’s your favorite piece published during Hellbound’s two years?** Possibly the Jucifer Canadian Tour Diary. I love those people.

**What are some of your best concert memories?** Rush, _Permanent Waves_ tour, 1980—You never forget your first.

Scorpions/Iron Maiden/Girlschool, 1982—A young and hungry Maiden about to take over the world, and a gleaming, seasoned Scorpions rocking out at their peak. (Cheers to Rob Kachluba for mentioning this show too.)

Monster Magnet, _Superjudge_ tour, 1993—Total rock gods.

Neurosis, _Through Silver in Blood_ tour, 1996—Walked into it having seen the “Locust Star” video only, and was summarily obliterated.

Sacramentary Abolishment, 1997—A friend and I flew to Edmonton for this show expecting something extreme, and we got it. I’ve never been more terrified.

**Black metal, death metal or grind?** It’s all good, really, as long as it comes from an honest place and either pushes forward or looks back in an interesting way.

**Person you’d like to interview but it hasn’t happened…** I can’t think of anyone right now. Adrian gave me some big assignments at Unrestrained!, including Morbid Angel, Ulver, Mastodon, Voivod, Cynic, and Devin Townsend. I took them for the personal challenge and because I knew Adrian trusted me to do a decent job, but man, each one was a nerve-wracking, exhausting experience. Really, I’m a fan, not a journalist, and I’m more than happy to limit my concerns to what I hear on albums, read in liner notes, and see on the concert stage.

**The most underrated metal album is:** Skyclad—_Prince of the Poverty Line_

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to fivemetal albums on repeat. What are they?** Voivod—_Angel Rat_ Celtic Frost—_To Mega Therion_ Black Sabbath—_Sabotage_ Metal Church—_Metal Church_ Budgie—_Bandolier_

It kills me that I couldn’t fit Iron Maiden or Metallica in there.
