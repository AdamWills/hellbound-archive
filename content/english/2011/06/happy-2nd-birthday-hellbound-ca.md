Today is the second anniversary of the launch of HELLBOUND.CA! Two years ago on this day the site went live for the first time with a small staff of excellent, dedicated writers and hopeful plans that weâ€™d be able to stick it out. Now (a sometimes astonishing) twenty-four months later we are still here with a cracking staff of writers, a pretty sizeable archive of reviews, interviews and features and a growing readership of some of the most fervent metal fans on the planet.

Thank you to everyone that has contributed to our site, either as a writer, a photographer or as someone who has helped us arrange interviews, get into live shows, sent us CDs for review or given us advice/criticism on the site. Also a special thanks to those labels - including Relapse Records, Sonic Unyon Metal, Metal Blade, Transcendental Creations and Profound Lore Records - who have inquired about and supported us with advertising without solicitation. Wow! And, of course, thanks to you for your continuing support and interest in Hellbound.ca. Not only do all of you enable us to do what we do, you also help make Hellbound.ca better.

Please join us for our third year, which we hope to be the biggest and best yet!

Regards,

Sean Palmerston Publisher - Hellbound.ca
