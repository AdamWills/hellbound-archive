I have known Kevin Stewart-Panko longer than any of the other current Hellbound contributors. We met sometime around 1993/94 while both of us were attending York University in Toronto. Kevin used to come hang out at CKLN with me when I was host of Aggressive Rock and I would sometimes write columns for his old zine _Doomhauled_. When I was asked about the possibility of taking over the Hellbound Radio show at C101.5 (now INDI 101) back in 2006, my first thought was to get Kevin involved as a co-host. So, naturally, when I started Hellbound, I asked Kevin if he'd have time to contribute between his writing for, well, everybody else. I'm glad he said yes, as his stuff is always so much fun to read. He's also a great person to travel with to fests, no matter where or when they are.

**Name and Location:** Kevin Stewart-Panko. Hamilton, ON

 

**How did you start writing for Hellbound?** Well, Palmerstonehenge and I have been friends for a thousand years, but specific to this, Rob Kachluba, Hugo, Sean and I were the original Hellbound Radio crew. Over time, people would come and go with Sean and I remaining from the initial quartet. When _Metal Maniacs_ went under, Sean was looking for a writing outlet, decided to start the website, use the Hellbound name and have the website loosely associated with the radio show. Since I sit across from him in the on-air booth every week, it was only natural that he ask me to contribute whenever I find the time amongst the however-many outlets I'm already writing for.

**What’s your favorite piece published during Hellbound’s two years?** Probably the review of the night Sean, Albert Mansour and I took my son to see Alestorm in Toronto. Justin M.. Norton's interviews with Count Grishnakh and Seth Putnam were pretty sweet as well.

**What are some of your best concert memories?** Fuck... I've been going to shows since the mid-80s and usually it's a chore for me to remember what I did last week. Umm...how's about seeing Metallica with Cliff on the "Lightning" tour and seeing the Dillinger Escape Plan in the basement of Who's Emma before _Under the Running Board_ was released. Watching Agata, the guitarist from Melt-Banana, do the 'Dance Dance Revolution' thing on his pedal board at any given Melt-Banana show is always worth writing home about.

**Black metal, death metal or grind?** Grind. I'm surprised so many of my Hellbound colleagues have answered this incorrectly thus far.

**Person you’d like to interview but it hasn’t happened…** Sean Palmerston.

**The most underrated metal album is:** Watchtower - _Control and Resistance_

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?** The Beyond - _Manic Sound Panic_ Graf Orlock - _Destination Time Trilogy_ Thought Industry - _Mods Carve the Pig: Assassins, Toads and God's Flesh_ Anacrusis - _Reason_ Metallica - _Master of Puppets_
