For today's installment of our ongoing Staff Interrogation series, we interview one of the most interesting and unique writers to join the Hellbound staff. When **Ola Mazzuca** first sent in a request to me about wanting to join our staff, it was the first one I received from someone I had never met before. Our first cold call! I was soon to find out that this talented young woman was just finishing up grade eleven, had already done an interview with Arch Enemy for another zine that was excellent and had a level of excitement to start contributing that was unparalleled.

Ola has been a very important part of the first two years of Hellbound and has used her writing for the site to her advantage too: she collected up her Hellbound writing and used it in her portfolio to apply for the Ryerson School Of Journalism in Toronto. Ola just completed her first year there and is now heading to Italy this Thursday for for a summer university exchange program, for which she also used her Hellbound contributions in her portfolio.

Way to go, Ola! I think the only people in the world more proud of you than I am are your parents.

**Name and Location:** Ola Mazzuca, Kleinburg, Ontario

**How did you start writing for Hellbound?** While on facebook, I came across the original Hellbound group that stated its launch on June 1st, 2009. I had already been writing for another small Canadian metal webzine and wanted to add more experience and writing to my repertoire so I decided to contact Sean, sent him some of my previously published work and the rest is history!

**What’s your favorite piece published during Hellbound’s two years?** The staff picks are always a favourite. Whether dedicated to Iron Maiden, Dio, Rush, Canada Day or our year-end poll, they are fun to read and a pleasure to contribute to. I love seeing the contrast between the responses of my colleagues. It’s intriguing to see everyone’s reflection and opinion on the music in general on a weekly basis in every piece.

**What are some of your best concert memories?** My very first real heavy metal show was Lamb of God at Toronto’s Kool Haus on August 25th, 2007. It was the summer before starting grade ten and I still get nostalgic thinking about it.

During the Lamb of God set, I was just on the edge of the moshpit, headbanging, creating the worst whiplash I’ve ever had. It was a humid summer night after a big rainstorm and the majority of the concert attendees were shirtless, sweaty guys. When I stopped windmilling my hair to “Now You’ve Got Something To Die For”, I lifted my head up only to be hit in the face with a guy’s sweaty nipple as he leaped from the pit. For about five seconds, I had a major freak-out, worried about the beautiful makeup job my friend had done and the repulsive experience I just had. I quickly evaluated between worry and how much fun I was having, and let go of my feminine anxieties to keep on headbanging.

**Black metal, death metal or grind?** Easy. Everyone knows this one. Black Metal! Of the true Norwegian kind…

**Person you’d like to interview but it hasn’t happened…** It’s a three-way tie between Sam Dunn, Anvil and Nardwuar the Human Serviette.

**The most underrated metal album is:** Darkthrone‘s _F.O.A.D_ is so bad ass; the blend of sub-genres create a really rebellious tone. It was a fresh comeback from Fenriz and Nocturno Culto and I love the fact that Fen’s personality really shines on this record.

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?** Emperor – _In The Nightside Eclipse_ Enslaved – _Vertebrae_ Iron Maiden – _The Number of the Beast_ Opeth – _Ghost Reveries_ Type O Negative – _October Rust_

**An album that will be on heavy rotation while studying in Italy this summer:** Mike Patton – _Mondo Cane_
