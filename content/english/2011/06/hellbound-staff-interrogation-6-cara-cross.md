One thing that I am very proud of with regards to Hellbound is the diversity of the writers involved. We have a lot of excellent scribes contributing on a regular basis that live all across Canada and now we even have our first European correspondent too. Well, sort of. When I first was contacted by Cara Cross she was living in beautiful Victoria, BC.

Currently living somewhere in Scotland, Ms. Cross is one of the most accomplished writers on the Hellbound staff, having recently been published in The Globe And Mail. It was an excellent piece, trust me, maybe I will ask her if she minds if we post a link to it from this article.

**Name and location:** Cara Cross, currently somewhere in Scotland.

**How did you start writing for Hellbound?** I’m a freelance writer that also happens to be a long-time metal fan. Why not combine the best of both worlds?

Kyle Harcott knew each other way-back-when in small town BC; he suggested I get in touch with Sean and write for Hellbound. And I’m having a blast doing it!

**What’s your favorite piece published during Hellbound’s two years?** That’s a really tough question. What I enjoy the most about Hellbound is writing that is focused on promoting -- and celebrating -- Canadian talent.

That being said, I was fascinated by Justin M. Norton’s interview with Varg, who seems to be as into The Cure as I am. I also really enjoy the staff playlists -- they always give me new ideas for bands to listen to.

**What are some of your best concert memories?** Seeing Peter Steele in the flesh after getting into an accident in my mom’s brand new car in downtown Vancouver. Being in to the front row for Slayer, before being crushed by a few thousand of my closest friends. Flying to Los Angeles to see Nine Inch Nails play a bar show, one of their last. Seeing one of my favourite bands of all time, The Haunted, on the worst day of my life. Photographing ISIS for Hellbound as they performed “So Did We.”

**Black metal, death metal or grind?** Death metal ekes out a win.

**Person you’d like to interview but it hasn’t happened…** Mike Patton.

**The most underrated metal album is:** Megadeth's _Youthanasia_

You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they? Opeth – _Blackwater Park_ Type O Negative – _Bloody Kisses_ Faith No More – _Album of the Year_ ISIS – _Panopticon_ The Haunted – _One Kill Wonder_
