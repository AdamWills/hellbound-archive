Today's Hellbound staff interview is with my son Spencer. As some of you may remember, he did a review of the Ghost album around the time of its release, so when he asked me if he could get interviewed for Hellbound too, how could I say no? By the way, today is his fourth birthday! Happy birthday Spence, you and your brother mean everything to me.

**How did you start writing for Hellbound?** Um Dad, I want to spell Hellbound. To love a blue song. Yeah, it’s really a record on iTunes.

**What’s your favorite piece published during Hellbound’s two years?** Um, it was when I talked to you about that record ([Ghost](http://www.hellbound.ca/2010/12/ghost-opus-eponymous/)).

**What are some of your best concert memories?** The blue song. \[_Spencer's never been to a live music performance - Sean_\]

**What is blue?** Well dad, I love the colours blue and green.

**Black metal, death metal or grind?** I want to listen to the Ghost music on the iTunes again. Can I?

**Person you’d like to interview but it hasn’t happened…** I want to talk to Mike from your work, dad. (That would be Mike Bell. [Follow him on twitter @MikedBell](http://www.twitter.com/mikedbell)).

**What do you think is the most underrated metal album of all time?** That blue album you play on iTunes (_Blue Record_ by Baroness)

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?** It would be only two albums, the blue album and Rush Baroness - _Blue Record_ Rush - _Moving Pictures_

**Anything you’d like to say to Hellbound readers?** I love work and I love my daddy.
