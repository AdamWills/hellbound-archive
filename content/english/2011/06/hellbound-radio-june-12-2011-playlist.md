Sean's been a little lax on putting up playlists for the radio show - I don't think he put one up at all while Kevin was on tour with KEN Mode, but here is the setlist for the first show the three hosts did together in the new INDI 101 studio in the basement of Mohawk College. This show occurred on Sunday, June 12th and was, as usual, a strange cross section of the world of metal.

Hellbound Radio airs every Sunday, 9pm-midnight EST on INDI 101, broadcasting from Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. Listen on-line at www.indifm.ca. Wanna request something or give us shit? (905) 575-2101 is the number to harass us at during the show.

Your hosts are Albert Mansour, Sean Palmerston and Kevin Stewart-Panko
