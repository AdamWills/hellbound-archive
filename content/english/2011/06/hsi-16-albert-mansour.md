I first met Albert Mansour when I was introduced to him by Rob Kachluba at a Kataklysm show in Hamilton. Rob kept telling me about this crazy metalhead guy from his gym that I needed to meet. I had seen him around at shows before, but that was our first introduction. Shortly after Hellbound launched Rob and I ran into Albert once more at a Testament show in Toronto and he asked about contributing. Albert has been taking photos and doing the odd review ever since. We've also become great friends, something that I cherish very much. My kids love when Albert comes over to visit or when we drop in to see him at his store. If you ever have the chance to meet him, don't pass it up. He's one in a million.

**Name and Location:** Albert Mansour, Hamilton, Ontario.

**How did you start writing for Hellbound?** Well, it started off after seeing a posting at the end of May 2009 by Sean Palmerston on the Braveboard that he was starting up a webzine and looking for Photographers / Writers for the new site. I got to talk to him face to face the week the site was born at a Testament concert in Toronto and asked if he need help for the site and the answer was yes. I have been working mostly on the photography part with Adam Wills and also help co-host the Hellbound Radio weekly radio show and occasionally do some writing too. I’m so pleased and proud to say I work for Hellbound.

**What’s your favorite piece published during Hellbound’s two years?** There are so many things on Hellbound! The CD reviews and rimshot articles by Kevin Stewart-Panko for sure. Also monthly staff playlists and our Hellbound Radio playlists too.

**What are some of your best concert memories?** Wow this question is pretty tough. I’ve been going to concerts since 1980. Probably number one would be Rock in Rio 1985 with Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Whitesnake, Ozzy Osbourne, AC/DC, Queen & Yes. Number two would be Rock in Rock 1991 (the metal day) with Sepultura, Megadeth, Queensryche, Judas Priest & Guns ‘n’ Roses. Number three would be the Saxon, Raven, Sodom, Iced earth, Uli Jon Roth on the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise that I went on in January, 2010 with Adrien Begrand, Kevin Stewart-Panko and Sean Palmerston.

**Black metal, death metal or grind?** Death “Fu#^ing” metal (Just check out the back of my t-shirt)

**Person you’d like to interview but it hasn’t happened…** I would enjoy interviewing Inertia Entertainment's Noel Peters. Noel must have some crazy stories to tell about bands that have flowed into Toronto over the years.

**The most underrated metal album is:** Sarcófago - _INRI_

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?** Metallica – _Master of Puppets_ Opeth - _Blackwater Park_ Slayer - _Seasons in The Abyss_ Kreator - _Pleasure to Kill_ Serpent Throne - _The Battle of old crow_
