Today's Hellbound staff interview is by request. When my eight year old son Kieran found out we were doing interviews with the writers of Hellbound, he asked me if he could be interviewed for the site. After thinking about it, I figured why not, so here is his interview. It's kind of cute; hope you enjoy it.

**Name and Location:** Kieran Palmerston, Hamilton, Ontario. **How did you start writing for Hellbound?** I never did that in my life, but I really like Hellbound and it is a really good website. My dad is the owner and creator of it and he works on it at night after my bedtime, which is 8:30. **What’s your favorite piece published during Hellbound’s two years?** Hmmm... I think that I really like the [food articles](http://www.hellbound.ca/2011/05/blasphemous-meals-3-fish-curry-and-inebriated-protein/) that [Ola](http://www.hellbound.ca/?s=Ola+Mazzuca&x=0&y=0) does - or the article with my pictures with Gwar. **What are some of your best concert memories?** One would be when Gwar ripped off a dummy’s head of the US president. My dad and Albert took me to meet them in London, Ontario and Gwar gave me some tickets to their concert because I was six years old. I was too tired to stay for Lamb Of God.

**You got in trouble at school for saying the name Hellbound.ca in your grade one class. What happened?** My grade one teacher put me in detention at recess on the bench inside for twenty minutes for asking her to go to hellbound.ca when she was on the internet in our class. Good thing it wasn’t second recess, because I really like second recess and it is my precious recess.

**Black metal, death metal or grind?** I think maybe death metal, rock or just black metal, because I don’t really know what grind is.

**Person you’d like to interview but it hasn’t happened…** I don’t think I’m age equipped to interview anybody, but maybe I would like to meet and talk to Iron Maiden. I really like Iron Maiden and especially their album _The Final Frontier_.

**What do you think is the most underrated metal album of all time?** I don’t know. Maybe a Rush album. I dunno.

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?** Rush - _Chronicles_ Iron Maiden - _The Final Frontier_ Voivod - _Voivod_ Marillion - _Family_ The Beatles - _The White Album_

**Anything you’d like to say to Hellbound readers?** I really hope that Albert and Uncle Rob read this. Awesome cool!
