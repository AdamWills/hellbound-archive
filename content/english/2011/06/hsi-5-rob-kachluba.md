Today's staff interview is with one of Hellbound's most knowledgeable contributors. Although he has never written for any other publications before writing for Hellbound, Rob Kachluba has been involved in the world of metal since the early eighties and is a diehard metal collector. Chances are that if you've been reading us since early on you have already seen the pictures of [his basement](http://www.hellbound.ca/2009/11/kachluba-metal-shrine/), known as the metal shrine. If you haven't, you need to take a peek.

Rob and I met shortly after I moved to Hamilton in 1998. Our friendship was sealed when he asked me to drive to Erie, PA to see Iced Earth with him on a Wednesday night during their _The Dark Saga_ tour. We've been close friends ever since and, when I got married in 2005, he stood up for me as my best man. Top notch dude this fellow is.
