Jason Wellwood is a busy dude. He's a husband and father of two, he is the station manager of CILU FM at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, ON. he co-hosts a local arts and music show on the community access channel in Thunder Bay and, when he has time, he writes reviews and interviews bands for Hellbound. I have known Jason now for close to nine years and always enjoy when I get the chance to chat with him. We've never met in real life, but I can tell you this: Mr. Wellwood is one solid dude.

**Name and Location:** Jason Wellwood – Thunder Bay, Ontario

**How did you start writing for Hellbound?** Sean and I knew each other through our ‘day jobs’ and I believe he’d seen a couple of reviews I had written for another online publication. He mentioned that he was starting up Hellbound as a hint, I think, to let me know that if I was interested in writing other places he’d be open to seeing some stuff from me. I was a new-ish dad at that point so I wasn’t up for jumping on board right away, but after reading Hellbound for about 6 months, I decided to see if Sean was up for some more contributors, he was, and here I am.

**What's your favorite piece published during Hellbound's two years?** Sean’s interview with Sam Dunn and Scot McFadyen was a great piece. I also really liked Justin M. Norton’s interview with Varg Vikernes.

As far as my own stuff? Hands down, the Phil Anselmo interview. I was amazed by how easy he was to speak to and how forthcoming he was.

**What are some of your best concert memories?** Being front row centre for Alice Cooper the last time he played Thunder Bay.

Hanging out with Adam Wills seeing Therese and Steph return to Thunder Bay as Mares of Thrace, and watching jaws drop all around the room as those two just destroyed the stage.

Watching Unleash the Archers play to an empty room with Brittany from Kobra And The Lotus, then watching Kobra and the Lotus with Brittney from Unleash the Archers.

Lemmy telling a heckler that he’d ‘kick his fucking head off’ if he didn’t shut up. And finding out later that Lemmy insisted on a banana cream pie before he played, which was oddly fitting.

That’s just off the top of my head...there have been so many....

**Black metal, death metal or grind?** What?! No power?! Guess I’ll go with Death then. Preferably old school, or at least bands keeping the old school feel alive. Though I do love me some good grind...

**Person you'd like to interview but it hasn't happened.** No surprise on this one: Alice Cooper.

**The most underrated metal album is:** Grim Reaper – _Rock You To Hell_ tied with Pantera – _Power Metal_

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?** Annihilator – _Alice In Hell_ Iron Maiden – _Seventh Son of a Seventh Son_ Helloween – _Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt. I_ Clutch – _Clutch_ Grave – _Into The Grave_
