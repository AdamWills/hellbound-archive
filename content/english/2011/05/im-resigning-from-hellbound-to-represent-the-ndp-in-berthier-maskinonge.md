Have you guys been following this at all? A handful of these [newly-elected NDP MPs](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/985085--reality-show-stars-students-museum-guides-meet-the-new-ndp-mps) are university students, including [one who's only 19](http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jUl1uDN-GKNu-YJoilCwUIlOokLQ?docId=6744237)! Considering that I already have my degree, I feel that I'm adequately qualified to represent some rural Quebec riding in the House of Commons as a New Democrat.  They might even make me an opposition critic.

Just look at [Ruth Ellen Brosseau](http://images.ctv.ca/archives/CTVNews/img2/20110503/470_ndp_rookie_110053.jpg), the new MP for Berthier-Maskinongé, who [unseated the Bloc Québecois incumbent by nearly 6,000 votes](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/myelection/ridings/042/) after spending her [campaign in Las Vegas](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/ndp-candidate-takes-mid-campaign-vacation-in-vegas/article1999879/). She lives in Gatineau, three hours away from her riding, and works at a [campus pub in Ottawa](http://www.cusaonline.com/olivers.html). Furthermore, [she doesn't speak French](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/982380--in-french-speaking-riding-ndp-candidate-speaks-little-french), at least not well enough to carry on a basic conversation with a radio interviewer. Now, the other candidates in her riding are [demanding that her nomination be invalidated](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/985610--liberals-seek-revenge-on-quebec-mp-who-won-without-campaigning) since there are people who signed her nomination form without being told what it was for, and others [who claim their signatures were forged](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/05/04/pol-ndp-brosseau.html). So I'm prepared to step up and take her place.

Unlike Ms. Brosseau, I speak French on a daily basis, and would be more than happy to conduct interviews in the province's working language. I have experience serving Quebec as a call centre representative, providing essential information and call transfers for people across the province. While I haven't been to Trois-Rivières, either, I know that they have an [annual metalfest](http://www.troisrivieresmetal.com/), which I pledge to support with government funding.

The one advantage that the current (not-for-long) MP has over me is her French-sounding last name. So I'll just have to change mine. Since they don't pronounce the letter H or the double R in French, I'm swapping them for an _e accent aigu_. Grégoire Éris sounds like a guy you'd meet at a bar in Mauricie, if you ask me. I'd probably buy him a beer.

Once the paperwork's been approved, I plan on heading down to Jack Layton's office and presenting myself. I'm sure he'll be thrilled to have a bi-election candidate who speaks joual French just as well as he does.

P.S.: As the unofficial NDP by-election candidate, I'm hereby announcing my unofficial campaign theme.  [Stephen Harper may have Collective Soul](http://www.vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=4606050&sponsor=), but I've chosen a tune to best represent the electorate of my riding: [3Tarded by the 3Tards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhtahFdlnnw).  (Since 97.4 per cent of Berthier-Maskinongé only speaks French, I don't think they'll get the joke.)  I'll be kicking off my campaign at the ['Tards 10th anniversary gig](http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=180534) tonite at the Horseshoe, provided that my new campaign fliers are ready in time.  They forgot the fucking _accent aigu_ on the first batch I printed.  Kinko's must be run by a buncha Liberals...

Peace,

Greg
