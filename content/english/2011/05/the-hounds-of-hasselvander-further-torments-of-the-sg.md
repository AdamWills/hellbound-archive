**By Steve Earles**

This twelve inch single is an awesome slab of doom, and that is as it should be, for this is work of Pentagram and Raven legend **Joe Hasselvander**! Once again, Rock Saviour Records have produced a beautifully packaged, fantastic sounding slab of vinyl, Rock Saviour deserve massive kudos for their dedication to the true format for listening to metal on!

The aptly named Side Heavy features two killer slabs of doom, "Godâ€™s Mountain" and "Plank of Doom"; the crushing riffs continue on Side Doom with "Crucible", while a further treat lies in a startling rendition of the Humble Pie classic, "One Eyed Trouser Snake-Rumba", which features an excellent vocal from Jimmy Kunes of Savoy Brown Fame, (also played with Exciter and now with 70s legends Cactus!).

A terrific release, exactly what one would expect from Hasselvander and Rock Saviour!
