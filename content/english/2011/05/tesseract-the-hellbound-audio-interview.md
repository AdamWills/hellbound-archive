In late April our Jason Wellwood had the chance to speak to Jay Postones of UK prog metal outfit TesseracT. The band was in the middle of their North American tour supporting Protest The Hero as well as their own debut album _One_. Here is a two-part audio interview that Mr. Wellwood did with Jay that originally aired on CILU-FM in Thunder Bay ON but it now presented here for your listening pleasure.
