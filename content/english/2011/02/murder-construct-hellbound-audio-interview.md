Interview by Jason Wellwood

Murder Construct** is the name of a new Los Angeles based grind outfit featuring members of **Cattle Decapitation, Exhumed, Fatalist, Intronaut** and others. Originally conceived nearly ten years ago by guitarist **Leon del Muerte**, the band recently released their first seven song EP through Relapse Records. Jason Wellwood recently had the chance to speak to Leon del Muerte over the phone, the results of which can be heard below.

This interview was originally done for Mr. Wellwood’s radio show “Blowing Up The Lakehead”, which airs each and every Monday night on CILU FM in Thunder Bay. If you ever get the chance, check out his show online because it is great and he does it all for the love of metal!
