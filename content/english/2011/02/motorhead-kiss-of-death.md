**By Sean Palmerston**

Thirty-plus years since their formation, Motörhead are more like an institution than a rock band. Much to the disbelief of some, the trio continue to make great album after great album with little fanfare from the mainstream press. In fact, the trio have made a string of fabulous studio albums since 1995’s _Sacrifice_. There is not one stinker in the bunch since then, with 2004’s _Inferno_ being their career best since _Ace of Spades_. Not surprisingly, the streak continues with _Kiss of Death_. There is not a lot to differentiate this album from the past few; the band obviously realise that if it is not broken it doesn’t need to be fixed. Instead, they simply offer up a dozen new tracks that range from super heavy ("Kingdom Of The Worm”) to catchy rock’n’roll ("Christine”) and even a bonus re-recording of their 1991 song "R.A.M.O.N.E.S.” In all it is somewhat workman-like in approach, but thanks to solid songwriting and another airtight performance by the veteran trio, _Kiss of Death_ keeps the Motörhead legacy alive.
