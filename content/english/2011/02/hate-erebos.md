**By Matt Lewis**

Holy fuck!!! I laughed and said that out loud when this record kicked in. The production is enormous! The drums and bass feel like I am being pummeled by Cain Velasquez in the stomach. The vocals are perfectly balanced between anger and hatred. The guitars are loud and it might seem overwhelming but it is all laid out in a straight line. It goes from A to B to C and its devilishly heavy all the way through. The album starts out with a nice and heavy acoustic number, and then it doesn't really slow down after that. The style reminds of Behemoth and Zyklon. More so of Behemoth with a little less of a blackened tinge. I wish _Demigod_ from Behemoth had this type of balance mixing wise. While everything on this album sounds huge it is clear and concise unlike the previously mentioned effort from Behemoth where the vocals were huge and nothing else. If I had one complaint it would be the style wears out towards the end, one or two less songs and the album would have made a bigger impact all the way through.
