**_Elysium_** seems to pick up right where _Polaris_ left off: with awesome sped up power metal. The guitar playing by **Matias Kupiainen** is inspired and the new life he brought to the band is obvious on the rousing sing-along of ‘Darkest Hours’. Follow up ‘Flaming Skies’ is another fist pounding, foot stomper and THAT is followed up by ‘Infernal Maze’ which starts off a little slower but not only speeds up, but has some amazing keyboard/guitar interplay as well. Then...well, then it bogs down a little. I’m not normally one to pick too much but **Timo Kotipelto** picks a register that’s just a little too low for him at the beginning of ‘Fairness Justified’ that on first listen elicited an outburst of laughter. I apologize for laughing Timo, but the note was too low and combined with your accent, ‘my heart’ comes out sounding like ‘muh haaaurt’. The song does improve but is definitely a bit of a plodder. It seems bogged down and there are even a couple of Zakk Wylde-esque squeals in the background that lead me to wonder if this wasn’t supposed to be their ‘Black Label’ song. It doesn’t feel like a Stratovarius song at all. Then, they pick things back up again with ‘The Game Never Ends’ which is another fast paced track with some terrific keyboard work from **Jens Johansson**. Not a great track but it’s a step up from the previous one.

Essentially, that’s how the album continues, some great pieces in the songs, but nothing that stands out as a great track overall. Title track ‘Elysium’ is like an 18 minute car ride with your elderly parent: too damn slow part of the time, too fast at the wrong moments, a couple of minutes of getting it just right. Unfortunately _Elysium_ (the album) fails to meet the expectations that _Polaris_ set out. I really wanted to love this album and gave it more listens than normal but I came out loving parts and feeling very ambiguous about others. The band has managed to create an awesome half record, while the rest is ‘okay’. That said it’s a damn sight better than the _Elements_ albums!
