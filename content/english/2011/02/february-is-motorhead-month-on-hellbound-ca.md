As you may or may not have noticed, the usual white background that makes Hellbound.ca looks so clean and pristine most of the time has been replaced by something a little darker for February... We are celebrating the history of Motörhead all month long over here at Hellbound, since the band has a new album out this month, will be touring across Canada and the Lemmy Movie is right around the corner. We figured why not? Not to mention of course that the band absolutely rules.

Each weekday this month we will be putting up more Motörcontent on the site, including album reviews, some concert and DVD reviews and - fingers crossed - a brand new interview with the man himself. So stay tuned, check out our coverage of the band and if Motörhead is heading your way do yourself a favour - go see them live! It's always a good time.
