**By Steve Earles**

The acquisition of new vocalist **Al Osta**, replacing Orange Goblin’s **Ben Ward**, has only made Ravens Creed’s music even more brutal. Opening with "Stampede of Skeletons", we’re treated to a mutant collision of Venom and Celtic Frost, complete with Tom G Warrior style death grunt! The excellently titled "Breaking The Lord" has a similar vibe to _Kill ‘Em All_ era Metallica (long before they became ‘Rock Stars’!). The song-writing here is particularly excellent. "Shoot The Wounded" has a fantastic groove, and "The Wires Will Kill You" truly lives up to its name, with no track outstaying its welcomes.

Ravens Creed is a truly great British metal band, and along with such bands as the Meads of Asphodel and Old Corpse Road, are really flying the flag for true, trend-free, British metal!
