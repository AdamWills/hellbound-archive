They might not be in the Guinness Book of Records alongside Manowar and Motorhead, but Georgian "black doomed sludge thrash" nomads Jucifer have been blowing the roofs offa tiny clubs for years.  Tonite, they make their annual trip to Toronto, where, for the second year in a row, they'll be playing the Bovine Sex Club.

The ol' Sweatbox isn't exactly the ideal place for 'em to play, IMO.  Though I doubt it's the smallest stage they've set foot on, there's simply no space for their 76 cabinets, necessitating a stripped-down approach.

Yes, you read that right.  They've got 76 cabs.  And I'm not making that number up, either.  It comes straight from their [Twitter page](http://twitter.com/#!/_JUCIFER_).  Hey, if it's too loud, you're too old, eh?

And believe you me, it will get loud.  I've seen 'em at Sneaky Dee's, where the walls were literally shaking.  The post-gig tinnitus was a bitch, too.  Although things won't be so bad in the cramped Bovine, what with the lesser amplification, I still wore ear plugs at last year's appearance.

Trust me when I say this: Jucifer is hazardous to your health.

...

That said, I might just pass on this one and save my hearing for an early doom gig tomorrow nite at the Smiling Buddha, of all places.  It's local scenester Kimpaler's birthday, and she's brought Blood Ceremony out for the occasion, along with a couple outta-towners in Rochesterian horror-doom outfit Blizaro, who blew minds at BC's CD release gig back in April, and female-fronted Bay Area doom trio Castle.  The latter features ex-Toronto thrasher Mat Davis (M.A.D.) on guitar and should compliment the headliners quite nicely.  They're also playing another gig at the Bovine--go figure, eh?--Friday after next.  [Check 'em out](http://www.heavycastle.com/).
