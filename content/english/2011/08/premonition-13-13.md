**By Gruesome Greg**

**Wino** is the man. There aren’t many other doom metal musicians who could put out a solo acoustic album I’d actually wanna hear, but I did quite enjoy some moments of _Adrift,_ his previous effort. That said, it’s good to hear the man plugged in again, fronting his fifth power trio (by my count).

The opener “B\_E\_A\_U\_T\_Y” is a mellow, melodic piece reminiscent of his solo work (both unplugged and plugged-in) that gets a good shot in the arm a la The Hidden Hand about halfway through. “Hard to Say” shows shades of The Obsessed in the signature hazy guitar smoke that Wino knows so well.

Things get a little preachy at times, with “Clay Pigeons” taking a confrontational tone over a funk-blues rhythm—while also taking time out for an extended solo. But “La Hechicera de la Jeringa” opens with a riff that fell straight from the doom tree and hit every branch on the way down—and there’s a couple more where that came from. “Modern Man” offers up another big barrel of pure-grain riffage. This is what it’s all about, right here!

Maybe I’m crazy, but “Deranged Rock ‘n Roller” sounds a little like Motorhead, Wino taking a page outta Lemmy’s playbook. Takes one to know one, I suppose. Anyways, this record adds another solid chapter to a long and storied career. Wino is God.
