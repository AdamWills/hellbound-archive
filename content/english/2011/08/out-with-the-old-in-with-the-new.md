If you were paying attention, you would've noticed that TooHighToGetItRight.com went offline last weekend.  I don't know the exact time of death, but I cancelled my hosting plan on Saturday morning before hopping on a bus to Rochester.  It was still online when I left, but not when I got back, so there ya go.  RIP THTGIR, 2007-2011.

That said, you haven't seen the last of me yet.  When I started receiving notice of my domain coming up for renewal, I reviewed my choices before registering a new URL, [gruesomeviews.com](http://gruesomeviews.com/).  It runs on the same software as this site, which means no more messy Web 1.0 layout and hard-to-navigate left nav.  (Saved me a bundle on web hosting, too...)

I'll still be writing for Hellbound on a weekly basis, and I'll keep sending Sean all my new reviews, but if you enjoyed reading [this one](http://www.hellbound.ca/2010/05/show-me-the-way-to-the-anchor-bar/), [that one](http://www.hellbound.ca/2010/08/i-can-now-proclaim-to-have-seen-peyton-pass-the-pigskin-in-person/), and [dat-there](http://www.hellbound.ca/2011/05/im-resigning-from-hellbound-to-represent-the-ndp-in-berthier-maskinonge/) blog post, then you'll wanna stop by the new site.  I plan on following a rigorous daily posting regime, but in the meantime, be sure to check out:

- [Some pics from last week's Pentagram gig in Rochester](http://gruesomeviews.com/2011/08/27/amateur-concert-photograpy-hour-pentagram-valiant-thorr-orodruin-montage-music-hall-august-20th/)
- [My haul from today's CKLN vinyl liquidation](http://gruesomeviews.com/2011/08/27/i-just-got-back-from-cklns-vintage-vinyl-sale-and-boy-are-my-arms-tired/)
- [A Musicians Wanted ad for a band that'll never get off the ground...](http://gruesomeviews.com/2011/08/27/musicians-wanted-for-sludge-metal-80s-pop-cover-band/)

I'm also looking to give away [The Last of the THTGIR T-Shirts](http://gruesomeviews.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/shirtpic.jpg).  If you can still fit into a Medium, [hit me up](http://gruesomeviews.com/2011/08/24/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/).  You can also [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/gruesomeviews), if you're into that kinda thing.

Peace,

Greg
