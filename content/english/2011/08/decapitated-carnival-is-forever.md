**By Ola Mazzuca** Nearly four years have passed since the metal scene lost a talented figure in the technical death spectrum, as Witold "Vitek" Kieltyka used his double bass kick to push the success of Decapitated, a band founded as a family unit with guitarist Waclaw "Vogg" Kieltyka, pummeling through precise notes and ultra-heavy headbanging in their pre-teens. The Polish deathstars return with a fifth studio release, _Carnival Is Forever_, not too far off from _Nihility_’s celebrated “Spheres Of Madness” yet closer to a fresh sound that provides fans with an ear-catching listen. There’s no mercy on the introduction, as “The Knife” carves a deep gash into the record with impact in its strict tempo control before the title track, almost hitting nine minutes, takes a different route by transitioning from solitary notes sans distortion intertwined with the relentless gutturals of Rafal "Rasta" Piotrowski. Despite having new drummer Kerim "Krimh" Lechner on board, Decapitated still hold things together, proving their strength in songwriting by throwing in the circle-pit friendly “Pest”, with its heavy bass and rippling snare. A solid track that closes the album strays far from a playlist of chugging technicality, sounding more of an ambient, progressive tune in comparison. Possibly an ode to the fallen Vitek, there is audible solace directed to Decapitated fans, assuring them that though their lineup has changed, they will continue to serve up distinct death metal in any way of what fate has in store.
