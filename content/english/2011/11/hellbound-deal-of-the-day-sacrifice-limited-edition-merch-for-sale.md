Canadian thrash legends (and Hellbound.ca favourites) **Sacrifice** recently played a special one-off show at the Trois Rivieres Metal Fest last month and made a special run of merchandise just for the festival. The band has a bit of merchandise left, so here is your chance to get some limited edition Sacrifice merch. The band has some tshirts, longsleeves and zipped hooded sweatshirts left in the L, XL and XXL sizes (all with the design that is shown on the tshirt below)
