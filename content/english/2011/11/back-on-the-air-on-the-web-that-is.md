When CKLN went off the air, I had it in the back of my mind that I'd be willing to get back into online radio at some point.  However, it had to be under the right set of circumstances.  I was looking for a station that specialized in stoner/sludge/doom with an open timeslot before most people went to bed.  Fortunately, I found it.  The first episode of Gruesome Tunes airs tomorrow at 6 pm!

Yeah, I've ditched the whole Smokin' Green thing.  I figure that Anvil are famous enough now that they don't need me promoting one of their songs that they don't even play live anymore.  The focus of the new program is on what's new and the underground.  The first episode will feature lotsa recent Small Stone tunes from the likes of Ironweed, Roadsaw, Red Giant and Gideon Smith & the Dixie Damned, as well as other shit from Argus, Neurosis, Suplecs and Megaton Leviathan, to name but a few.

Be sure to tune in Sunday nites from 6 to 8 pm Eastern Time at [SteamingHeathen.com](http://www.steamingheathen.com/delusion/).  Yes, this will be a weekly broadcast; will see about posting these online for download, too...

Peace,

Greg
