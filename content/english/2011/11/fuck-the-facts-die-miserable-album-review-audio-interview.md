**Album review and Audio Interview (directly after it) by Jason Wellwood**

**Fuck The Facts** never shy away from change. It seems, in fact, that the band embraces progression as much as they embrace chaos. Everything that the band has put out, from the early 'one man band' projects to _Unnamed_ EP have all been works of passion, of (dare I say it?) art. Fuck The Facts really seemed to find their groove on Stigmata High Five and that progression carried through on the next two releases (_Disgorge Mexico_ and a split with Leng Tch'e) as well as the aforementioned Unnamed EP. _Die Miserable_ continues the band's growth and may actually be the most complete, beginning to end, feeling album the band has done. The addition of new, permanent members since the last full length has really pushed the song-writing in Fuck The Facts for the better. As usual, **Topon Das** has come through with some incredible riffs though this time they have a little more old school death metal feel with maybe a hint at some classic rock love as well. I've always been a big fan of **Mel Mongeon**'s vocals, I'm constantly amazed by both the power and passion of her voice. It’s easy to feel like she’s standing in front of you yelling at you while beating you over the head to make sure you understand. The addition of **Marc Bourgon**'s (bass) vocals really floored me this time around though. If you need proof of the progression and fearlessness of Fuck The Facts, check out his vocal lines on 'Census Blank'! It’s unexpected, oddly fitting and a powerful change. Having Mel and Marc trade off on vocals is a treat on record and I'm sure will translate well to the stage. There is a lot of sonic experimentation that happens on _Die Miserable_ and the entire process from writing to recording to mixing to mastering had to be done in stages as the band were burning themselves out. Taking time to step back from this album was definitely a good idea, as Fuck The Facts have taken a big stride forward with _Die Miserable_.

**Topon Das** has stated that he never wants to release music to sell another shirt design or simply because the band is going on tour. He wants to be proud of the albums he makes and to be able to listen to them for years to come. With _Die Miserable_ there is no fear that there will be any regrets.
