**By Rob Kachluba**

Fast becoming one of my fave thrash bands, Holland's **Legion Of The Damned** have turn it up a notch with _Descent Into Chaos_, focusing on a more direct full frontal thrash assault. Using **Peter Tagtgren** as producer and mixer has helped LOTD get to the next level. Every instrument can be heard clearly but it still comes across heavy and tight.They loosen the strings a bit on the anti-Christian sentiment this time, going for more darker, violent themes. Titles like "Lord of the Flies" (based loosely on the same book), "Holy Blood, Holy War" and "Killzone" are just a few of the venom spilled violent topics. They also turned down the speed factor a tad and are writing more midpaced thrashers, almost getting a Metallica/Slayer vibe which guitarist **Richard Ebisch** had hinted at in recent interviews. Where LOTD excel is in the riff department. They write high quality riffs into their songwriting that deliver a wall of controlled chaos backed by a high energy rhythm section and the venom spewed vocals of **Maurice Swinkles** can still be clearly heard. Apparently they spent more time on this album than the rushed effort of _Cult of the Dead_ and it shows in spades. They also traveled to Sweden as mentioned earlier to work with Peter Tagtgren and it looks like they came up with a winner. I have the cd/dvd version and as bonus they rework one of their classics with guest vocal spot by Peter Tagtren. If you want simple no nonsense thrash delivered in a frenzy high octane effort then you can do no wrong with _Descent Into Chaos._
