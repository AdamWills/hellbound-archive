**By Matt Lewis**

_Doombox_, the new EP from movie grindmasters **Graf Orlock** is coming to remind us all of the obscure and not so obscure movies with great lines complimented by great fucking music. With a new lead vocalist that is hilarious and brings an old punk vibe to the music, **Graf Orlock** is bringing the grind, old school style. While the new EP is only 6 songs, it delivers.  Having great pacing with speed and aggression it is not always balls to the wall. **Graf** **Orlock** is keeping it real, real grind.  I might be uninformed, but as far as I know there's no cover of a theme song from a movie this time around which is something I loved on the last couple of releases.  The doombox itself looks great - like an big old cassette stereo ghettoblaster from the 80's.  If you like grind and movies then this band is for you. \[It's also worth noting that the new _Doombox_ EP is a 10" vinyl release and it comes packaged with a CD that has their last three trilogy records on it (42 songs total). - Da Ed\]
