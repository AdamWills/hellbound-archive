…in which one Kevin Stewart-Panko passes his shaven-and-slanted-head judgment on three slabs of vinyl courtesy our good friends at various record companies. And a-way we go…

_UNHINDERED BY SCUM_ – Split 7”

Wow, someone hates today’s extreme music and ain’t afraid to show it. If you’re still wondering who, it’s these two old-school, thrash-core rippers who’ve teamed up to let you in on how much they despise the sounds, trends, fashions and trappings of just about anything that came out after 1992 and wasn’t on Earache. As you might expect, there isn’t an original note to be had on either side of this clear vinyl 7”, though **Black Market Fetus** is a bit more nuanced and metaphorical in their all-encompassing slag-fest when compared to **Brody’s Militia** who cover Sore Throat’s “The Crossover is Over” and “The Return of the Son of the Crossover is Over” as bookends to the finger-pointing fastcore temper tantrums that are “Dead Wolves and Dying Whores” and “Grow Out of It.”

_THE LAST SESSION_ – 7”

I was in a Mexican restaurant a couple weeks and ago and somehow got into conversation with the guy behind the counter who informed me that _The_ _Last Session_ has actually been out for something like a year. Who knew? “Not I,” said I, before explaining, “It’s a triumph on those days I can pay someone to pay attention for me.” This red 7” culls the five songs recorded at BBC Radio One during the Hamilton/Toronto band’s ill-fated final tour and is basically for collectors and mega-fans, as it simply sounds like the band wailing through a quick and dirty rehearsal. One thing that I did pick up on in listening to this is just how much space vocalist **Chris Colohan** fills in with his razor-like tongue; the dude’s engine-like holler is everywhere, rarely letting up. He’s somewhat reminiscent of the way former **Kataklysm** vocalist **Sylvain Houde** would take one massive breath at the beginning of a song and then be off to the fucking races. Off to the fucking races, indeed.

SPLIT 12”

Two bands. Both play fast, splintery hardcore. Both really remind of **the Accused**. Specifically, the _More Fun than an Open Casket Funeral_ and _Martha_ Splatterhead’s Maddest Stories Ever Told albums (not that the Accused have really mutated all that much over the years). Brian Walsby does the “mirror image” cartoon/artwork for the dual cover. It’s pretty good for a raging party or to clear the room of a not-so-raging party, but nothing you can’t live without.
