After taking part in all the Hellbound year-end stuff, I've gone one step further in uploading my third annual Year in Review on [TooHighToGetItRight](http://www.toohightogetitright.com), with my Top 10 albums and concerts of the year, as well as my Top 5 EPs.  Check it out [here](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/2010top10.html).

Unfortunately, a good chunk of the recordings on said lists were reviewed for StonerRock.com, which has come out with a snazzy [memorial graphic](http://www.stonerrock.com/) in the past coupla days.  So said reviews are no longer online.  I might hafta repost 'em either here or on THTGIR, though they're not exactly current anymore.

On a side note, I'm pleased that two of my top five records made our [overall top 10](http://www.hellbound.ca/2010/12/top-20-albums-of-2010-part-three/), and that Mares of Thrace had the Canadian album of the year.  Lotsa solid Canadian bands absent from that list, though.  Guess I'm the only who's into Keef, Quest For Fire, Mendozza, Chron Goblin and Cauchemar, but I digress.

Anyways, I'll be playing cuts from all my Top 10 albums and Top 5 EPs tonite on Smokin' Green, so be sure to tune in from 1 till 3 am at 88.1 fm on yer radio, channel 947 on yer TV or [www.ckln.fm](http://www.ckln.fm/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=150&Itemid=205) on yer computer!  Playlist for said episode will be posted at [this location](http://toohightogetitright.darkbb.com/t149-episode-88-january-1-2011) at 3 am sharp.

Heavy New Year!

Peace,

Greg
