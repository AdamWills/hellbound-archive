**By Gruesome Greg**

As an owner of **Weedeater**'s entire discography (three albums and counting), I had a pretty good idea of what to expect from their latest release. With _Jason... The Dragon_, they neither surprise nor disappoint.

Taking cues from Eyehategod and the NOLA scene, **Weedeater** delivers their own take on southern sludge metal, accented by the whiskey-soaked vocals of madman **“Dixie” Dave Collins**. A couple tracks stand out for being off-the-map, but I don't hear any anthems on this one.

“Palms of Opium” is a bit of a sidebar, with its mellow, folksy surf-blues stylings, and Dixie Dave's signature vocals sounding a tad outta place. “Whiskey Creek” ends the album with banjo and running water giving way to piano after a brief pause. Otherwise, it's a solid 28 minutes of southern sludge metal.

A little on the short side, and lacking in any memorable tunes, _Jason... The Dragon_ is only somewhat satisfying. That being said, I won't object to another **Weedeater** tour, provided that it stops somewhere close by.
