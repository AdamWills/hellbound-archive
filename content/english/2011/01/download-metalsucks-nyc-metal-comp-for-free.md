It's not often that we step out of our safezone and post news on Hellbound.ca, but I think this one is worthwhile - and who doesn't like a free, legal download?!?

The dudes over at [MetalSucks](http://www.metalsucks.net) have put together a great, free compilation of NYC metal bands, highlighting the current scene in the Big Apple. Some are more well known than others (Made out Of Babies, Black Anvil) and some are gonna be major names in the news in the next year (Mutant Supremacy, Castavet), but all of them are worth checking out. Here's the artwork, track listing and "the link"!
