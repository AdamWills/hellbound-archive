**By Gruesome Greg**

Long before the digital promo invitation arrived in my inbox, I knew that the new **Wino** record was going to be an acoustic album. Now, I'm generally not too fond of acoustic folk/blues, and my last experience with a sludge/doom icon gone solo nearly bored me to tears. Frankly, I'll never know what convinced **Scott Kelly** that doing an unplugged set in between fully-amplified **YOB** and **Sleep** was a good idea—incidentally, he's opening for **Wino** on his _Adrift_ tour.

Then again, when it comes to the post-sludge mastery of **Neurosis**, Kelly's vocal stylings were never the strongest selling point. On the other hand, Wino's mournful cries lifted **Saint Vitus** from a sorta-slow trad metal band to one of the greatest doom metal outfits of all time. (_Born Too Late_ wouldn't have been what it was with Reagers, no way, even though I liked his voice on the early stuff...) With his legendary pipes and distinctly emotive guitar playing, I figure that if anyone in the doom scene can pull of an unplugged album, it's Wino.

The title track, which leads off Adrift, is almost Gordon Lightfooteque in its tale of love lost at sea. “I Don't Care” is more what I expected, a bluesy anthem to rebellion with a coupla wailing (electric) guitar solos. It isn't the last song to feature plugged-in soloing, either.

Wino's most rugged vocal work comes on his unplugged version of **Motorhead**'s “Iron Horse/Born To Lose,” a song that's been covered many times, yet seems so well-suited to his acoustic interpretation. Meanwhile, album-closer “Green Speed” contains his shreddiest solo. Dude really rips it on that tune!

Although I've got no grading scale or any reference points when it comes to acoustic folk, I will say that if you worship Wino, you'll want this. Personally, _Born Too Late_ is more of what I turn to when I want to mellow out and relax, but if your eardrums have been overly abused, and you need something more soothing—yet haunting in its stripped-down honesty, then _Adrift_ should be good for a spin or two. Beats the hell outta **Scott Reeder**'s _Tunnelvision Brillance_, for whatever that's worth.
