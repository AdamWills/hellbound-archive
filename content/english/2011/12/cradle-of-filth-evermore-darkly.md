Did my stereo just shuffle to a Thrillseekers record in the midst of _Evermore Darkly_, or is this still Cradle of Filth playing? Cause I swear I just heard **Dani Filth** say, “forgive me father, for I have sinned” to an electronic rhythm.

Track six is indeed a trance edit of “Forgive Me Father (I Have Sinned)” and an entertaining one that could pass as CoF’s take on Rammstein’s “Du Hast”. But this isn’t the only turn in the road, as the English black metallers begin with a cliché intro of an accented narration of an old propaganda broadcast.

Things get thrashy on “Thank Your Lucky Scars” with classic blastbeat and chunky riffs, before “The Spawn of Love and War” is symphonic, dark and fluctuating in tempo. Witch-like vocals are strongly effeminate on “The Persecution Song”, its mood rough and far from ethereal.

The EP is an offshoot of their 2010 release, _Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa_, proving so with an orchestral version of CoF oldie, “Summer Dying Fast.” So, nothing’s really new in the Filthy world of metal, but the record is entertaining and classically Cradle nonetheless.
