**By Sean Palmerston**

In late October Sean had the chance to speak to Canadian vocalist **Stu Block** about his recent decision to join **Iced Earth**. Stu and I had a brief chat about how he came to join the legendary American power metal band band, about writing and recording the new _Dystopia_ album, future touring plans for the band and that cool new mid-range voice that has come alive on this new album.

_Dystopia_ is available now on Century Media.
