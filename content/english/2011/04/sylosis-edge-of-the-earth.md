**By Rob Kachluba**

Coming out nowhere a few years back these young lads from England known as **Sylosis** released a monster debut of precise razor sharp melodic metalcore that raised quite a few eyebrows for its consistent songwriting. Being all in their late teens and early twenties made it even more of a nice surprise. This sophomore effort sees their old singer leaving and being replaced internally by **Josh Middleton**â€”the brains and the multi-instrumentalist of the band. For the most part they give up most of their metalcore leanings and dive head first into a modern thrash sound. Loads of razor sharp riffing back by melodic soloing and crazed, all-out drumming. They do slow down the pace with some slower melodic passages and clean vocals but for the most part its a all out thrashfest. One thing that really jumps out at you is the phenomenal musicianship. These guys are the real deal and with a bit more emphasis on some stronger songwriting and maybe a shorter length - 70mins seems to be a tad too long for this kind of music - really big things could lie ahead.
