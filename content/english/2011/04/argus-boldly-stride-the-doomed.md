**By Gruesome Greg**

Argus' self-titled album is one of my favourite doom debuts of the past couple years. This is a band that gets it: dual guitars, soaring vocals, shades of Trouble, Candlemass, et al, without being complete copycats. Ever since I first got word of this follow-up effort, I've been looking forward to it with great anticipation.

After a brief acoustic intro, the band gets right into it with a pair of driving, mid-paced numbers that reference Maiden and Dio just as much as Candlemass, though one can't help but succumb to the slithering, snake-like riffs that held you captive as frontman Butch Balich begs for mercy on “Wolves of Dusk,” ushering a change of pace that brings the number down to a devastating crawl. This is plenty of prime slow-motion headbanging material to be found as this one slowly but surely exceeds the six-minute mark.

“The Ladder” and “Durendal” are jam-packed with solid doom-metal riffage and tasty, melodic solos while Balich's voice soaring overtop like a true Messiah. His screams in the epic “42-7-29” are at once primal, plaintive yet soothing while the chiming bells and dual guitar leads deliver a sense of dread.

_Boldly Strides_ ends on a slow note with the slow, burly crushers “Facing Silver Light” and 11-minute epic “Pieces of Your Smile,” which goes from power to doom to trad metal and back again with some well-placed time changes.

The title track is the perfect culmination of the band's sophomore effort. Moving at a more-than-mid-paced gallop, with some killer melodic riffs and Dioesque chorus, “They are the dead,” it neatly packages all that is good with this album. Boldly strides Argus, lookout!
