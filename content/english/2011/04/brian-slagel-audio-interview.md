Earlier this week Jason Wellwood had the opportunity to speak to Metal Blade founder and owner Brian Slagel over the phone about his label, which will celebrate an incredible thirty years in business next year. Here is that interview in its entirety, where they discuss many different topics related to the label and its longevity - as well as a few questions that we at Hellbound really wanted to know the answers to. Plus Jason also throws some NHL hockey questions in there too.

This interview is divided into two parts due to youtube limitations, so please make sure to check out both parts.
