Unless you order it online, that is.  I've seen plenty of copies of the new Ghost and Electric Wizard records around town, but when it comes to _Living with the Ancients_, Metal Blade seems to have dropped the ball.  I can appreciate that these things probably aren't flying off the shelves in North America, but you'd think there'd still be some interest in getting a record by Toronto's biggest doom metal band on the shelves of Toronto's major record stores.  I mean, it's not like we're talking about a semi-obscure outfit from Japan like Church of Misery here, or an underground American band like The Gates of Slumber...  (Bought both of their latest ones online--thanks Metal Blade!)

It could be worse, I suppose.  Remember when Rise Above partnered with [The Music Cartel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_Cartel)?  Hell, Blood Ceremony's debut album was distributed domestically by Candlelight, but never showed up round here till the band put on a CD release party, some nine months after the fact.  (Good thing I got a promo copy for radio...)  I gotta say, that was [one helluva gig](http://www.toohightogetitright.com/reviews/concerts/jan309.html), though!

Fortunately, we won't hafta wait as long this time around, since the band will be releasing its second opus tonite at The Garrison before heading off on a [European tour](http://www.myspace.com/thebandghost/blog/540746896) with their ghastly label mates.  Support comes from [Blizaro](http://www.hellridemusicforums.com/forum/showthread.php?t=24038)\--a psychedelic side-project of Rochester doom titans Orodruin--who've had their name misspelled on many a [gig listing](http://ftp.loudvine.com/profile/live-music/90242/blood-ceremony-bizarro-holy-mount), including [the venue's](http://www.garrisontoronto.com/listings.html).  (Can't they read [the poster](http://toohightogetitright.com/Blood+Ceremony+Record+Release+w+Holy+Mount++l.jpg)!?  The other bands' names are pretty small, but still...)  Opening the show is local heavy psych trio [Holy Mount](http://www.myspace.com/holymountainisloud), who are worth showing up early for.  Doors open at 9, but I wouldn't expect them to go on before 10.  After all, this isn' t the [Metalliance tour](http://www.hellridemusicforums.com/forum/showpost.php?p=393712&postcount=54) we're talking about...

In a bout of bad scheduling, there is another heavy gig taking place a few blocks east this evening.  Ottawa's most fucked-up downer-rock duo [Muffler Crunch](http://mufflercrunch.com/) are in town supporting local scene stalwarts [Electric Magma](http://www.electricmagma.com/) and semi-supergroup  [Gypsy Chief Goliath](http://www.myspace.com/gypsychiefband) at the Hard Luck Bar.  If female-fronted flute doom isn' t your thing, for whatever reason, then Hard Luck is better than no luck at all.

**Blood Ceremony _Living with the Ancients_ CD Release with Blizaro, Holy Mount @ The Garrison, 1197 Dundas W, $8, Doors @ 9.**

**Gypsy Chief Goliath with Electric Magma, Muffler Crunch, Devilz by Definition @ Hard Luck Bar, 812 Dundas W, (probably) $5, Doors @ 8.**

Peace,

Greg
