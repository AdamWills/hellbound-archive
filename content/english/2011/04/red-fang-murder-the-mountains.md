**By Gruesome Greg**

Back in the day, **Sea of Green** moved the mountains on their _Northern Lights_ EP, but **Red Fang** takes things one step further, putting a gun to those mountains' heads, and making them beg for their lives before pulling the trigger on _Murder the Mountains_. Alas, the gruff vocal stylings on opening track “Malverde” are more reminiscent of Mister Bones, while “Wires” is a tasty strip of angular sludge a la Fiftywatthead.

Elsewhere, the album crawls along at a slug's pace, tunes reaching the five-minute mark with ease. “Painted Parade” sounds a little like Kylesa, with its drum-driven intro and vocals channelling Phil Cope. “Number Thirteen” sounds the most like something offa their self-titled record, but for the most part, album number two is one sludgy step forward for the Fang.
