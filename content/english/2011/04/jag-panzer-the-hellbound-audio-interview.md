Earlier this year veteran US power metal outfit **Jag Panzer** raged back into the spotlight with their excellent new album **The Scourge Of The Light**, the band's first album for new label SPV. Hellbound's **Jason Wellwood** recently had the chance to interview Jag Panzer guitarist and founding member **Mark Briody** for his weekly radio program on CILU-FM, but here is that audio interview presented in its entirety for your listening pleasure.

This interview was originally done for Mr. Wellwood’s radio show “Blowing Up The Lakehead”, which airs each and every Monday night on CILU FM in Thunder Bay. If you ever get the chance, check out his show online because it is great and he does it all for the love of metal!
