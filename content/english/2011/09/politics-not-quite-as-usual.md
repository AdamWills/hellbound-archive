**by Jay H. Gorania**

Exploiting the turbulence of the world in every way imaginable, the political campaigning cycle in the United States has become a nauseating, 24/7 machine that simply never stops. Any break from the monotony of prudish American political ads would be an event worth welcoming. Sure, we probably won’t find that any time soon stateside, but in Poland, someone is straying from the norm in the most entertaining way possible...for metalheads, anyway.

**Jedrzej Wijas**, a politician involved with Poland’s Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) party, has just unleashed something that resembles a death metal video more than a political campaign ad. Taking on the appearance of a death metal vocalist in the video, the metalhead politician spouts his message, which translates into English as:

“End of the useless talking / Enough of the stupid wars / Secular government / Dignified life / Freedom / Is my goal / Vote wisely.”

Politics as usual? Hell no! \\m/
