Last week Winnipeg's **KEN Mode** played Toronto's Garrison as part of their current North American tour in support of their brand new album _Venerable_, which is released today on Profound Lore. I caught up with KM guitarist/vocalist Jesse Matthewson outside of the venue just before they played to do a quick video interview in which we discuss the current tour, the new album and their working association with Profound Lore. Oh yeah - watch for the rat in the window of the store during the video too!
