**Words and photos by Adam Wills**

Toronto's Kool Haus was packed in anticipation of the legendary Motörhead, currently touring for their latest album _The World Is Yours_, and fans were definitely not disappointed.  Opening up, were North Carolina rawkers Valient Thorr who's high paced, high spirited performance warmed up the crowd for Clutch, whose stoner-rock comes off great in a live setting.  Vocalist **Neil Fallon** sounds great live, and despite not having nearly the same live energy that their predecessors did, still managed to come off as the better of the two openers.

What can be said about Motörhead that hasn't been said before?  At 65 years of age, Lemmy is still the master of his craft, pumping out riff after riff, and scratchy vocal after vocal, much to the chagrin of the sold out crowd.  Although I wasn't able to stay to the end of the set, their performance was yet another gem among the hundreds (if not, thousands) of shows in the band's long-lasting history.
