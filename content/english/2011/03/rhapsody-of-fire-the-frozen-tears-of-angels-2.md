**By Ola Mazzuca**

_The Frozen Tears of Angels_ is the third installment into Rhapsody of Fire’s concept derived from their fantasy story, The Dark Secret Saga, infusing an array of Baroque-tinged tracks with traditional metal riffs and stunning narration by Christopher Lee – Saruman the White in Peter Jackson’s _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy.

How fitting it is to acquire the right people and make strong connections between music and text, especially on the introduction “Dark Frozen World”, where Lee’s theatrical voice captivates before transitioning to the 80s thrash-worthy, sweep-picking whirlwind “Sea of Fire”.

The majority of the album is so heavily operatic and full of boastful virtuosity, leaving time for only one solemn contrast piece, “Lost In Cold Dreams”, and “Danza di Fuoco E Ghiaccio (Dance of Fire and Ice)”, where Rhapsody of Fire take lyric reference from their roots while infusing folk with an ocarina-esque melody.

Rhapsody of Fire are true storytellers on the record, and the music works well in conjunction with audiences familiar with everything from Middle Earth escapades to the grand picture power metal paints in our minds, resulting in an experience that is both aural and visual.
