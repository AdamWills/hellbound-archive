I met Bill Adams when we both wrote for another publication that really doesn't need to be mentioned. We've kept in touch over the years and about a year or so ago I asked him if he'd be interested at all in contributing to Hellbound. His tastes are more on the punk end of things, but I'm glad to have him around.

**Name and Location:** Bill Adams - Waterloo, Ontario **How did you start writing for Hellbound?** Sean Palmerston and I met ages ago (probably about seven years) through work (me for an ill-fated mag called Spark, and him because of his day job) and began intermittent contact for various articles and press endeavors. A few years later, we ended up on the same masthead at three other publications (one of which no longer exists), so of course contact continued. Eventually, both Sean and I got sick of being taken advantage of by the publisher of those three mags (well, that was the reason for my departure anyway, Sean may have left for other reasons that I'm not aware of) and elected to part ways with the company, but we remained in contact. When Sean told me he was starting Hellbound, I offered my services as a writer in spite of not being much of a metalhead, but liking older hard rock and loving both punk and hardcore. He agreed so, when I've got something sort of aggressive to talk about, I write about it for Hellbound - if Sean's interested. **What’s your favorite piece published during Hellbound’s two years?** Of my own? It's Time To Go OFF! with Keith Morris. Of someone else's? Sean Palmerston's review of Motorhead at Elements in Kitchener. **What are some of your best concert memories?** Most recently, getting to see The Stooges FILL and close off four streets around Dundas Square, Phil Campbell asking the crowd at Elements if they wanted Motorhead to turn up the already ear-bleeding volume at Elements. **Black metal, death metal or grind?** Grind. **Person you’d like to interview but it hasn’t happened…** Lemmy Kilmister, Iggy Pop, Henry Rollins, Ozzy Osbourne **The most underrated metal album is:** The one Pat Boone made.

**You are suspended in limbo for eternity and can only listen to five metal albums on repeat. What are they?** Uhm, the closest to metal, I'd say, are _Raw Power_ by The Stooges, _No More Tears_ by Ozzy Osbourne, _Highway To Hell_ by AC/DC, _Ace Of Spades_ by Motorhead _Independent Worm Saloon_ by Butthole Surfers.
