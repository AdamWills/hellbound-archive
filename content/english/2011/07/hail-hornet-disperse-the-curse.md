**By Gruesome Greg**

What do you get when you cross Dixie Dave with T-Roy Medlin? Well, whatever it is, it can be found in **Hail! Hornet**, a Carolina sludge supergroup combining the forces of two of the state’s biggest names with a couple former members of Sourvein and Alabama Thunderpussy.

Some angry, heavy breakdowns on “Shoot the Pigs” make you wanna do just that. “Disperse the Curse” spreads the sludge gospel with some slow southern steel. “Beast of Bourbon” is a little outta left-field, a tad faster, with clear, rumbling bass and a lengthy, shred-metal solo, while “Kill the Liars” takes a more hardcore/crust approach to sped-up sludge, with some killer time changes. “Blacked Out in Broad Daylight” is a long, slow and creepy closer that leaves a lasting impression.

Personally, I prefer this record to Weedeater’s latest. Not quite up there with the new Sourvein, which is excellent, but a solid, sludgy release, for sure.
