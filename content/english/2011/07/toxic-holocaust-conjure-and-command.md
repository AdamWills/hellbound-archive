**By Renee Trotier** **Toxic Holocaust**’s latest release _Conjure and Command_ is an album made for reckless summer driving. Aggressively fast and rebellious in nature, it’s the type of crusty thrash that leaves you feeling exhausted and gritty just for having heard it. If Joel Grind wrote the soundtrack to a successful car jacking, this is what it would sound like.

While the production here is fairly warm and enveloping, the vocals have a rawer edge which consciously de-polishes the entire thing. Songs like “I am Disease” inject a bit of black metal reverb while personal favourite “Bitch” adds a dose of punk. Really though, these are just seasonings for what is a true speed metal album through and through. It’s fast, dirty and not too serious, but it sure is a hell of a ride.

Simply put, _Conjure and Command_ is Joel Grind at his most vicious and it’s Toxic Holocaust’s most noticeable album to date. Whatever’s pissing this dude off we’re lucky to be reaping all the benefits.
