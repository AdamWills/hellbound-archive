**By Gruesome Greg**

Album number six from grungey experimental desert rockers **Totimoshi**. Not only do they wear their Melvins and Neurosis influences on their sleeves—they actually got Dale Crover and Scott Kelly to make guest appearances on this record.

“Mainline” is a slow, sludgy depressive tune, a depressing shot of whiskey to the veins, before it goes off into leftfield like a bad acid trip. “Calling All Curs” is another zonked-out number, a trippy instrumental featuring buzzsaw surf guitar and pounding acid rock drums. What starts out as a fairly straight-ahead tune in “Opus” turns into a wild, psychedelic rocker worthy of its title. The ending of penultimate tune “Snag” and album-closer “Waning Divine” give _Avenger_ a bit of a NeurIsis feel at its apex.

This record runs the gamut from cool to quirky to slightly-boring alt-rock slog, leaving no stone unturned along the way. Not for the closed of mind.
